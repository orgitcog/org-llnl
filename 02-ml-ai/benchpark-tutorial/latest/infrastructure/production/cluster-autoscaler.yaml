# The roles defined in this config file set permissions on several Kubernetes resources.
#
# Resources referred to:
#   * events: resource representing information/responses generated from actions or changes taken against the cluster
#   * endpoints: resource representing REST API endpoints within the cluster
#   * pods/eviction: resource that terminates and removes pods when created
#   * pods/status: resource used to query or edit the status of pods
#   * nodes: resource representing the physical or virtual nodes of the cluster
#   * namespaces: resource representing a group of isolated resources within the cluster
#   * pods: resource representing a unit of computation that is deployed to a node
#   * services: resource representing a networked application running in a pod and exposed over the network (either internal to the cluster or external to the broader internet)
#   * replicationcontrollers: legacy resource for managing horizontal scaling (i.e., scale-out). Used for broader support across clouds
#   * persistantvolumeclaims: resource representing a request for storage by a user
#   * persistantvolumes: resource representing actual storage
#   * replicasets: resource that creates replica pods that are used to ensure some minimum number of identical pods in the cluster
#   * daemonsets: resource that ensures copies of pods are deployed to new nodes and removed from removed nodes
#   * poddisruptionbudgets: resource that represents the cluster policy regarding the minimum number of pods that must remain available
#                           during voluntary disruptions (i.e., pod/node eviction not caused by something like hardware failure)
#   * statefulsets: resource that maintains pod state
#   * storageclasses: resource that describes different types of storage. Often used for things like QoS levels
#   * csinodes: resource that describes a node's ability to interact with one or more storage providers. Mainly used by Kubernetes's scheduler
#   * csidrivers: resource that provide information on the drivers for a single storage provider installed on a node
#   * csistoragecapacities: resource that describes the available storage from different providers
#   * jobs: resource that represents one-off tasks spread across one or more pods that must run to completion. Useful for certain types of setup and elasticity work
#   * leases: resource that allows different pods, nodes, or kublets (kubernetes daemon on a node) to lock shared resources. Think of it like a mutex
#   * configmaps: resource representing non-confidential key-value pair info. Often used to decouple environment-specific configuration from container images
