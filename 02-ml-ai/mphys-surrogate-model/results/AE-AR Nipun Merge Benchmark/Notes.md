This set of folders shows the results after the full merge of Nipun and Emily's code. 
While the results aren't exactly the same, they're very close - probably within the
random seed variability.

I'm taking this time to change from `np.log` to `np.log10` in the test set plotting function.
The `Natural Log` folder shows the results with `np.log`, while the `Log10 Original Bounds` folder
shows the exact same results but with `np.log10` for comparison. The `Log10 New Bounds` folder
shows the same results but with a new set of bounds. These results can be used to compare
"new" results to the results in the old repo.
