Bootstrapping and Bayesian calibration both provide distributions over $\\beta$, but these distributions have different interpretations since the bootstrap distribution characterizes the uncertainty in the least squares model parameter estimates over different datasets, whereas the posterior distribution quantifies uncertainty in the model parameters given the observed data.  Given these two interpretations, can you think of examples where one distribution would be preferred over the other?\n",

    "3. Is the posterior correlation between $C_0$ and $S$ positive or negative?  Can you give an intuitive explanation why this is the case?\n",

    "4. In the MCMC simulation, experiment with varying the thin parameter and observe how the autocorrelation function changes as a function of this parameter.  Also set the burn-in parameter to 0 and modify the code in `mcmc.get_samples` so that the initial values for the chains are more dispersed.  How does this appear to affect the convergence of the chains?\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Read about the normal-inverse-gamma distribution on [this Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal-inverse-gamma_distribution).  Modify the `mcmc.log_prior` function to implement this distribution, which requires adding the parameters $\\mu,V,\\alpha$, and $\\beta$.  Run the MCMC analysis with $\\mu=(3.8,1.6)'$, $V=I_2$, $\\alpha=0.5$, and $\\beta=0.2$, or with other values you choose.  Do the MCMC samples from the posterior distribution of $\\beta$ appear normal?  Explain why or why not."
