# Overview

This repository contains material for an uncertainty quantification (UQ) class on equation of state (EOS) that was presented at Science of Compression in Condensed Matter (SCCM) 2025. It includes a Python package called eosuq for analyzing linear shock compression data. The package performs Bayesian linear regression analytically and with Markov Chain Monte Carlo, and provides a bootstrap approach for comparison. The methods are demonstrated in a notebook on publicly available data contained in the notebooks directory. The dataset, from shock compression experiments on copper, is from pages 57-60 of Marsh, S. P. (1980), "LASL Shock Hugoniot Data".

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**
```bash
    git clone https://github.com/LLNL/SHOCK-UQ.git
    cd SHOCK-UQ
```

2. **Create a virtual environment**
```bash
    python3 -m venv .venv
```

3. **Activate the virtual environment**
```bash
    source .venv/bin/activate
```

4. **Install dependencies**
```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
```

5. **Install the `eosuq` package locally**
```bash
    pip install -e .
```

6. **Launch Jupyter notebook** The notebook is located in the `notebooks` directory.
