# Contributing Guidelines

This is an open source project, under the [GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE, Version 3](LICENSE). We welcome contributions via pull requests as well as questions, feature requests, or bug reports via issues.

If you would like to contribute to the development of this project, please contact [camilo@llnl.gov](mailto:camilo@llnl.gov). All contributions, including patches and pull requests, will be reviewed. Submission does not guarantee acceptance. Review timelines are unpredictable and may be lengthy. Please do not expect a prompt acknowledgement or response.

**Scope of Contributions**</br>
This project accepts contributions in the following areas:

- Bug fixes
- Documentation improvements
- Performance optimizations

Feature requests and new functionality may be considered, but this project maintains a narrow focus. Before investing significant time on a contribution, consider reaching out to discuss whether it aligns with the project's direction.

The following are generally out of scope:
- New external dependencies
- Major architectural changes
- Features outside the core focus of the paper

If you aren't a developer at LLNL, you won't have permission to push new branches to this repository. First, you should create a fork. This will create your copy of the repository and ensure you can push your changes up to GitHub and create PRs.

* Create your branches off the `repo:main` branch.
* Clearly name your branches, commits, and PRs as this will help us manage queued work in a timely manner.
* Articulate your commit messages in the imperative (e.g., `Adds new privacy policy link to README`).
* Commit your work in logically organized commits, and group commits together logically in a PR.
* Title each PR clearly and give it an unambiguous description.
* Review existing issues before opening a new one. Your issue might already be under development or discussed by others. Feel free to add to any outstanding issue/bug.
* Be explicit when opening issues and reporting bugs. What behavior are you expecting? What is your justification or use case for the new feature/enhancement? How can the bug be recreated? What are any environment variables to consider?

## Reporting Bugs
If you encounter a bug, please open an issue with a clear description of the problem, steps to reproduce it, and any relevant environment details (OS, version, etc.). Do note that not all reported bugs will be addressed, and there is no guaranteed timeline for fixes.

## Licensing
By submitting a contribution, you agree that your work will be licensed under the same license as this project.
