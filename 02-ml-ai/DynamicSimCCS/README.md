# DynamicSimCCS

This code accompanies the manuscript, "Advancing carbon capture from bench to pilot scale using dynamic similitude", accepted for publication at _Cell Reports Physical Science_.

This code solves for the one-dimensional concentration and temperature distribution within a carbon capture column using a homogenized absorber model. These solutions are compared to experimental data.

The *.ipynb files generate the figures from the manuscript.
