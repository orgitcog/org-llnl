# HPC Job Scheduler Event Schema - Version 2

NOTE: Work in Progress!

Tools being targeted:

- Slurm Job Logs
- Flux Job Logs

## Job Completion Log Schema

This schema is for the job completion information of a completed job. In Slurm, this information is controlled by the `JobComp*` fields, such as `JobCompType` and `JobCompLoc` (see: <https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html> for more information).

The columns for "Slurm" and "Flux" represent the field in that data set which is used to retrieve the value.

| **Field Name**           | **Data Type** | **Field Explanation**                                                                                         | **Slurm**       | **Flux**         |

- Data Types are as defined by [Elastic Field Data Types](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/mapping-types.html)
- \* Event fields defined by the [Elastic Common Schema (ECS)](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/ecs/current/ecs-field-reference.html)
- \*\* Indicates that value is derived from other values, and not reported directly from the tool.

### Notes

* Some of the `event.*` fields are not guaranteed to be populated in a Flux job
if the job is cancelled or fails before proceeding to its `RUN` state. See
[RFC 21 - Job States and Events Version 1](https://flux-framework.readthedocs.io/projects/flux-rfc/en/latest/spec_21.html) for more details.
