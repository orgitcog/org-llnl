Please run setup.sh to:
	1. Download libopenblas-dev
	2. Install aihwkit to a Python virtual environment
	3. Run minimal_example.py to test your installation

I had some issues installing aihwkit in PyCharm since the package was unable to find my OpenBLAS implementation; 
however, I had no issues installing/using it in Linux (specifically WSL in Windows).
