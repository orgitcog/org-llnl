RAJA Performance Suite
======================

[![Azure Piepline Build Status](https://dev.azure.com/llnl/RAJAPerf/_apis/build/status/LLNL.RAJAPerf?branchName=develop)](https://dev.azure.com/llnl/RAJAPerf/_build/latest?definitionId=1&branchName=develop)
[![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/rajaperf/badge/?version=develop)](https://raja.readthedocs.io/en/develop/?badge=develop)

The RAJA Performance Suite is a companion project to the [RAJA] C++ performance
portability abstraction library. The Performance Suite designed to explore
performance of loop-based computational kernels found in HPC applications.
Specifically, it is used to assess and monitor runtime performance of kernels 
implemented using [RAJA] compare those to variants implemented using common 
parallel programming models, such as OpenMP and CUDA, directly.

User Documentation
-------------------

The RAJA Performance Suite User Guide is the best place to start learning 
about it -- how to build it, how to run it, etc. 

The RAJA Performance Suite Developer Guide contains information about 
how the source code is structured, how to contribute to it, etc.

The most recent version of these documents (develop branch) is available here: https://rajaperf.readthedocs.io

To access docs for other branches or version versions: https://readthedocs.org/projects/rajaperf/
