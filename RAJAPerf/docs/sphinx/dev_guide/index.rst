RAJA Performance Suite Developer Guide
########################################

The RAJA Performance Suite project follows nearly identical development 
processes as RAJA, which are documented in the 
`RAJA Developer Guide <https://raja.readthedocs.io/en/develop/sphinx/dev_guide/index.html>`_ 

This guide describes development items that are specific to the RAJA Performance
Suite and refers to sections in the RAJA Developer Guide on common things to
avoid redundancy and simplify documentation maintenance.
