### Matrix-based Parallel Redistribution

matred is a parallel redistribution tool for HPC applications. It provides a simple approach that only requires a few relation matrices between entities to build redistribution matrices in parallel simulation codes. In particular, matred is well-suited for simulation codes based on finite element/volume methods.
