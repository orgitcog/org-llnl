 * @brief Newton-Raphson solver for nonlinear solid mechanics problems
 *
 * @details This class implements Newton's method for solving nonlinear systems of the form F(x) = b
 * where F is a nonlinear operator. It extends MFEM's IterativeSolver to provide specialized
 * functionality for ExaConstit's solid mechanics applications.
 *
 * The solver uses the Newton-Raphson iteration:
 * x_{i+1} = x_i - [DF(x_i)]^{-1} [F(x_i) - b]
 *
 * Key features:
 * - Device-compatible implementation for CPU/GPU execution
 * - Integration with MFEM's operator and linear solver framework
 * - Specialized handling for NonlinearForm operators in solid mechanics
 * - Automatic scaling factor adjustment for convergence improvement
 * - Caliper performance profiling integration
 *
 * The method GetGradient() must be implemented for the operator F.
 * The preconditioner is used (in non-iterative mode) to evaluate
 * the action of the inverse gradient of the operator.

/**
 * @brief Newton-Raphson solver with line search for enhanced convergence
 *
 * @details This class extends ExaNewtonSolver to include a line search algorithm that
 * improves convergence robustness for highly nonlinear problems. The line search method
 * uses a quadratic variation approach to find an optimal scaling factor for each Newton step.
 *
 * The line search algorithm:
 * 1. Evaluates the residual at three points: x, x - 0.5*c, x - c
 * 2. Fits a quadratic polynomial to these residual norms
 * 3. Finds the minimum of the quadratic to determine optimal step size
 * 4. Falls back to heuristic rules if the quadratic fit is invalid
 *
 * This approach is particularly useful for:
 * - Large deformation problems with geometric nonlinearities
 * - Material models with strong nonlinearities (e.g., plasticity, damage)
 * - Problems where standard Newton-Raphson exhibits oscillatory behavior
 *
 * The method GetGradient() must be implemented for the operator F.
 * The preconditioner is used (in non-iterative mode) to evaluate
 * the action of the inverse gradient of the operator.
 *
 * Reference: Based on quadratic variation line search described in
 * "Numerical Methods for Large Eigenvalue Problems" (https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-01970-8_46)

     *
     * 1. **Standard Newton Setup**: Compute residual and Jacobian as in standard Newton

     *    - Evaluate residual at x - c: q3 = ||F(x - c) - b||
     *    - Evaluate residual at x - 0.5*c: q2 = ||F(x - 0.5*c) - b||
     *    - Current residual: q1 = ||F(x) - b||
     *    - Fit quadratic: ε = (3*q1 - 4*q2 + q3) / (4*(q1 - 2*q2 + q3))
     *    - Apply optimal step: x = x_prev - ε*c
     * 3. **Fallback Strategy**:
     *    - If quadratic fit is invalid: ε = 1.0 (full Newton step)
     *    - If full step increases residual: ε = 0.05 (heavily damped step)
     *    - If algorithm fails completely: terminate with convergence failure

     * - Prevents divergence in highly nonlinear problems
     * - Reduces oscillatory behavior near solution
