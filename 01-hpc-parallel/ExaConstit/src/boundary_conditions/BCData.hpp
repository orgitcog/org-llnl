/**
 * @brief Individual boundary condition data container and processor
 *
 * @details This class stores and processes data for a single boundary condition instance.
 * It handles the application of Dirichlet boundary conditions for velocity-based formulations
 * and manages component-wise scaling for different constraint types.
 *
 * The class supports component-wise boundary conditions where different velocity components
 * can be constrained independently using a component ID system:
 * - 0: No constraints
 * - 1: X-component only
 * - 2: Y-component only
 * - 3: Z-component only
 * - 4: X and Y components
 * - 5: Y and Z components
 * - 6: X and Z components
 * - 7: All components (X, Y, Z)
