 * integration.
 *
 * ExaNLFIntegrator implements a comprehensive finite element integrator specifically designed
 * for ExaConstit's solid mechanics applications, including crystal plasticity, large deformation
 * mechanics, and general material model integration. This integrator serves as the foundation
 * for nonlinear finite element assembly operations in updated Lagrangian formulations.
 *
 * The integrator provides:

 * - Element matrix assembly for Jacobian computation (tangent stiffness)
 * - Partial assembly (PA) operations for memory-efficient matrix-free methods
 * - Element assembly (EA) operations for minimal memory usage
 * - Device-compatible implementations for CPU and GPU execution
 *
 * Key features for crystal plasticity and micromechanics:
 * - Integration with ExaConstit's material model framework
 * - Support for heterogeneous material regions through SimulationState
 * - Quadrature function data access for stress and tangent stiffness
 * - Optimized assembly operations for large-scale simulations
 * - Compatibility with MFEM's assembly level abstractions
 *
 * Assembly strategy support:
 * - Traditional element-wise assembly for small problems
 * - Partial assembly for memory-efficient large-scale problems
 * - Element assembly for memory-constrained environments
 * - Mixed assembly strategies for heterogeneous hardware
 *
 * The integrator coordinates with SimulationState to access:
 * - Current stress tensors from material model evaluations
 * - Material tangent stiffness matrices for linearization

 * @brief B-bar method integrator for incompressible and nearly incompressible solid mechanics.
 *
 * ICExaNLFIntegrator extends ExaNLFIntegrator to implement the B-bar method for handling
 * incompressible and nearly incompressible materials. This integrator is essential for
 * crystal plasticity simulations where volume preservation constraints arise from
 * incompressible plastic deformation or nearly incompressible elastic behavior.
 *
 * The B-bar method (Hughes, 1980):
 * - Modifies the strain-displacement B-matrix to avoid volumetric locking
 * - Uses volume-averaged dilatational strains to improve element performance
 * - Maintains accuracy for incompressible and nearly incompressible materials
 * - Enables stable finite element solutions for high bulk modulus problems
 *
 * Mathematical foundation:
 * The B-bar method splits the strain into volumetric and deviatoric parts:
 * ε = ε_vol + ε_dev, where ε_vol is volume-averaged over the element
 *
 * This approach prevents spurious pressure oscillations and volumetric locking
 * that can occur with standard displacement-based finite elements when dealing
 * with incompressible or nearly incompressible material behavior.
 *
 * Applications in crystal plasticity:
 * - Incompressible plastic deformation in crystal slip
 * - Nearly incompressible elastic response in metals
 * - Volume-preserving deformation in single crystal simulations
 * - Polycrystalline materials with incompressible phases
 *
 * Key features:
 * - Inherits all standard solid mechanics capabilities from ExaNLFIntegrator
 * - Modifies B-matrix construction for volumetric strain averaging
 * - Maintains compatibility with all assembly strategies (PA, EA, standard)
 * - Provides stable solutions for high bulk modulus materials
 * - Supports large deformation kinematics with volume preservation
 *
 * Implementation details:
 * - Computes element-averaged volumetric strain gradients
 * - Modifies standard B-matrix with B-bar corrections
 * - Uses Hughes' formulation from "The Finite Element Method" Section 4.5.2
 * - Maintains computational efficiency comparable to standard elements
