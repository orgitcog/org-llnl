 * @brief Comprehensive time step management and adaptive time stepping for ExaConstit simulations

 * - **Multiple Time Step Types**: Fixed, automatic, and custom time step sequences
 * - **Adaptive Time Stepping**: Automatic adjustment based on Newton-Raphson convergence behavior
 * - **Sub-stepping Recovery**: Automatic sub-stepping when convergence fails
 * - **Boundary Condition Synchronization**: Time step modification to hit exact BC change times
 * - **Failure Handling**: Sophisticated retry logic with progressive time step reduction
 * - **Final Time Detection**: Accurate detection of simulation completion
 * - **Restart Capabilities**: Complete state save/restore for checkpoint/restart
 *
 * **Time Step Types Supported**:
 * - **FIXED**: Constant time step throughout simulation (with failure handling)
 * - **AUTO**: Automatic adjustment based on solver performance
 * - **CUSTOM**: User-defined sequence of time steps from input
 *
 * **Adaptive Algorithm**: For AUTO mode, time step is adjusted using:
 * factor = (max_nr_steps * dt_scale) / actual_nr_steps
 * where fewer Newton iterations lead to larger time steps and vice versa.
