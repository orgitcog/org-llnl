# Neutral ABL over terrain at Altamont Pass

This is an example input file for neutral atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) conditions over
Patterson Pass in the Altamont Pass Wind Resource Area with fixed wind conditions. Turbulence is
generated by the terrain. For demonstration purposes, the vertical resolution and extent of the
domain is limited:

```python
dz0 = 10.0 # surface grid spacing
gsr = 1.05 # grid stretching ratio
nz = 40
ztop = dz0 * (gsr**(nz+1) - 1) / (gsr - 1)  # partial sum formula
# ztop = 1278.4
```

The solver executable is compiled in Exec/ABL.
