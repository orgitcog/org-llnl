# Canonical Convective ABL

This is an example input file for a convective atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) based on case "B"
from Moeng and Sullivan 1994. Two anelastic simulation setups are provided for specified heat flux
or specified temperature (heating rate).

The solver executable is compiled in Exec/ABL and provides options for initial perturbations
including deterministic divergence-free velocity perturbations as well as random velocity and/or
temperature perturbations.
