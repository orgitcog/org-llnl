# RADIUSS Clingo Install

The RADIUSS project promotes and supports key High Performance Computing (HPC)
open-source software developed at the LLNL. These tools and libraries cover a
wide range of features a team would need to develop a modern simulation code
targeting HPC plaftorms.

RADIUSS Clingo Install is a sub-project from the RADIUSS initiative providing a
testing infrastructure to test that clingo installs correctly on any LC machine
of interest. It does so automatically in GitLab while tracking changes in
Spack.

## Getting Started

that consists in installing spack from scratch and perform a simple
concretization that will install clingo.
