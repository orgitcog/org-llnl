/**
 * @brief Central nonlinear mechanics operator for updated Lagrangian finite element formulations.
 *
 * NonlinearMechOperator drives the entire ExaConstit nonlinear mechanics system, implementing
 * an updated Lagrangian finite element formulation for large deformation solid mechanics.
 * It manages the Newton-Raphson solver, Krylov iterative solvers, material models, and
 * coordinates the interaction between finite element operations and constitutive models.
 *
 * The class extends MFEM's NonlinearForm to provide specialized mechanics operations including:
 * - Updated Lagrangian formulation with current configuration updates
 * - Material model integration (crystal plasticity, UMAT, multi-model support)
 * - Partial and element assembly support for high-performance computing
 * - Jacobian computation and preconditioning for Newton-Raphson convergence
 * - Deformation gradient calculation and coordinate updates
 * - Essential boundary condition management
 *
 * Key features for large-scale simulations:
 * - GPU/CPU device compatibility through MFEM's device abstraction
 * - Memory-efficient partial assembly operations
 * - Support for heterogeneous material regions
 * - Automatic coordinate updating for finite deformation problems
 * - Integration with ExaConstit's simulation state management
 *
 * The operator works in conjunction with SimulationState to manage:
 * - Current and reference configurations
 * - Material state variables across time steps
 * - Boundary condition updates
 * - Multi-material region handling
