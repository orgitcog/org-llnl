death is the termination of all biological functions that sustain a living organism phenomena which commonly bring about death include biological aging senescence predation malnutrition disease suicide homicide starvation dehydration and accidents or trauma resulting in terminal injury bodies of living organisms begin to decompose shortly after death death of humans has commonly been considered a sad or unpleasant occasion due to the termination of social and familial bonds with the deceased or affection for the being that has died other concerns include fear of death necrophobia anxiety sorrow grief emotional pain depression sympathy compassion solitude or saudade the word death comes from old english dea which in turn comes from proto germanic dauthuz reconstructed by etymological analysis this comes from the proto indo european stem dheu meaning the process act condition of dying the concept and symptoms of death and varying degrees of delicacy used in discussion in public forums have generated numerous scientific legal and socially acceptable terms or euphemisms for death when a person has died it is also said they have passed away passed on expired or are gone among numerous other socially accepted religiously specific slang and irreverent terms bereft of life the dead person is then a corpse cadaver a body a set of remains and when all flesh has rotted away a skeleton the terms carrion and carcass can also be used though these more often connote the remains of non human animals as a polite reference to a dead person it has become common practice to use the participle form of decease as in the deceased another noun form is decedent the ashes left after a cremation are sometimes referred to by the neologism cremains a portmanteau of cremation and remains almost all animals who survive external hazards to their biological functioning

dyeing is the process of adding color to textile products like fibers yarns and fabrics dyeing is normally done in a special solution containing dyes and particular chemical material after dyeing dye molecules have uncut chemical bond with fiber molecules the temperature and time controlling are two key factors in dyeing there are mainly two classes of dye natural and man made the primary source of dye historically has generally been nature with the dyes being extracted from animals or plants since the mid th century however humans have produced artificial dyes to achieve a broader range of colors and to render the dyes more stable to resist washing and general use different classes of dyes are used for different types of fiber and at different stages of the textile production process from loose fibers through yarn and cloth to completed garments acrylic fibers are dyed with basic dyes while nylon and protein fibers such as wool and silk are dyed with acid dyes and polyester yarn is dyed with disperse dyes cotton is dyed with a range of dye types including vat dyes and modern synthetic reactive and direct dyes the word dye is from middle english deie and from old english dag and dah the first known use of the word dye was before the th century archaeologists have found evidence of textile dyeing dating back to the neolithic period the earliest surviving evidence of textile dyeing was found at the large neolithic settlement at atalh y k in southern anatolia where traces of red dyes possibly from ocher an iron oxide pigment derived from clay were found in china dyeing with plants barks and insects has been traced back more than years early evidence of dyeing comes from sindh province in pakistan where a piece of cotton

the human skull is the bony structure that forms the head in the human skeleton it supports the structures of the face and forms a cavity for the brain like the skulls of other vertebrates it protects the brain from injury the skull consists of two parts of different embryological origin the neurocranium and the facial skeleton also called the viscerocranium the neurocranium or braincase forms the protective cranial vault that surrounds and houses the brain and brainstem the facial skeleton is formed by the bones supporting the face except for the mandible all of the bones of the skull are joined together by sutures synarthrodial immovable joints formed by bony ossification with sharpey s fibres permitting some flexibility various sources provide different numbers for the count of constituent bones of the human neuro and viscerocranium the reasons for such counting discrepancies are numerous different textbooks classify the bones of the human skull differently e g they may also include parts of bones that are ordinarily considered neurocranial bones in their list of facial bones some textbooks count paired bones where there is one bone on each side only once instead of twice some sources describe the maxilla s left and right parts as two bones likewise the palatine bone is also sometimes described as two bones the hyoid bone is usually not considered part of the skull as it does not articulate with any other bones but some sources include it some sources include the ossicles three of which on each side are encased within the temporal bones though these are also usually not considered part of the skull extra sutural bones may also variably be present but they are not counted for all of these reasons it may not be easy or useful to reach agreement on an
a symbol is an object or a concept that represents stands for or suggests another idea visual image belief action or material entity symbols take the form of words sounds gestures ideas or visual images and are used to convey other ideas and beliefs for example a red octagon may be a symbol for stop on a map a blue line might represent a river numerals are symbols for numbers alphabetic letters may be symbols for sounds personal names are symbols representing individuals a red rose may symbolize love and compassion the variable x in a mathematical equation may symbolize the position of a particle in space in cartography an organized collection of symbols forms a legend for a map the word derives from the greek symbolon meaning token or watchword it is an amalgam of syn together bole a throwing a casting the stroke of a missile bolt beam the sense evolution in greek is from throwing things together to contrasting to comparing to token used in comparisons to determine if something is genuine hence outward sign of something the meaning something which stands for something else was first recorded in in edmund spenser s faerie queene in considering the effect of a symbol on the psyche in his seminal essay the symbol without meaning joseph campbell proposes the following definition a symbol is an energy evoking and directing agent later expanding on what he means by this definition campbell says heinrich zimmer gives a concise overview of the nature and perennial relevance of symbols in the book signs and symbols it is stated that a symbol is a visual image or sign representing an idea a deeper indicator of a universal truth symbols are a means of complex communication that often can have multiple levels of meaning this
pallor mortis algor mortis rigor mortis livor mortis putrefaction decomposition skeletonization decomposition is the process by which organic substances are broken down into a much simpler form of matter the process is essential for recycling the finite matter that occupies physical space in the biome bodies of living organisms begin to decompose shortly after death animals such as worms also help decompose the organic materials organisms that do this are known as decomposers although no two organisms decompose in the same way they all undergo the same sequential stages of decomposition the science which studies decomposition is generally referred to as taphonomy from the greek word taphos meaning tomb one can differentiate abiotic from biotic decomposition biodegradation the former means degradation of a substance by chemical or physical processes e g hydrolysis the latter one means the metabolic breakdown of materials into simpler components by living organisms typically by microorganisms decomposition begins at the moment of death caused by two factors autolysis the breaking down of tissues by the body s own internal chemicals and enzymes and putrefaction the breakdown of tissues by bacteria these processes release gases that are the chief source of the unmistakably putrid odor of decaying animal tissue prime decomposers are bacteria or fungi though larger scavengers also play an important role in decomposition if the body is accessible to insects mites and other animals the most important arthropods that are involved in the process include carrion beetles mites the flesh flies sarcophagidae and blow flies calliphoridae such as the green bottle fly seen in the summer the most important non insect animals that are typically involved in the process include mammal and bird scavengers such as coyotes dogs wolves foxes rats crows and vultures citation needed some of these scavengers also remove and scatter bones
biological processes are the processes vital for a living organism to live biological processes are made up of any number chemical reactions or other events that result in chemical transformation metabolism and homeostasis are examples regulation of biological processes occurs where any process is modulated in its frequency rate or extent biological processes are regulated by many means examples include the control of gene expression protein modification or interaction with a protein or substrate molecule
life on earth life outside the solar system life is a characteristic distinguishing physical entities having biological processes such as signaling and self sustaining processes from those that do not either because such functions have ceased death or because they lack such functions and are classified as inanimate various forms of life exist such as plants animals fungi protists archaea and bacteria the criteria can at times be ambiguous and may or may not define viruses viroids or potential artificial life as living biology is the primary science concerned with the study of life although many other sciences are involved the smallest contiguous unit of life is called an organism organisms are composed of one or more cells undergo metabolism maintain homeostasis can grow respond to stimuli reproduce either sexually or asexually and through evolution adapt to their environment in successive generations a diverse array of living organisms can be found in the biosphere of earth and the properties common to these organisms plants animals fungi protists archaea and bacteria are a carbon and water based cellular form with complex organization and heritable genetic information abiogenesis is the natural process of life arising from non living matter such as simple organic compounds the age of the earth is about billion years the earliest life on earth arose at least billion years ago during the eoarchean era when sufficient crust had solidified following the molten hadean eon the earliest physical evidence of life on earth is biogenic graphite from billion year old metasedimentary rocks found in western greenland and microbial mat fossils in billion year old sandstone found in western australia some theories such as the late heavy bombardment theory suggest that life on earth may have started even earlier and may have begun as early as billion years ago according
in biology an organism is any contiguous living system such as an animal plant or bacterium more than of all species amounting to over five billion species that ever lived on earth are estimated to be extinct estimates on the number of earth s current species range from million to million of which about million have been documented and over percent have not yet been described all known types of organisms are capable of some degree of response to stimuli reproduction growth and development and homeostasis an organism consists of one or more cells when it has one cell is a unicellular organism and when it has more than one it is known as a multicellular organism most unicellular organisms are of microscopic size and are thus classified as microorganisms humans are multicellular organisms composed of many trillions of cells grouped into specialized tissues and organs an organism may be either a prokaryote or a eukaryote prokaryotes are represented by two separate domains the bacteria and archaea eukaryotic organisms are characterized by the presence of a membrane bound cell nucleus and contain additional membrane bound compartments called organelles such as mitochondria in animals and plants and plastids in plants and algae all generally considered to be derived from endosymbiotic bacteria fungi animals and plants are examples of kingdoms of organisms within the eukaryotes in thomas cavalier smith author of branching order of bacterial phyla proposed a clade neomura which groups together the archaea and eukarya neomura is thought to have evolved from bacteria more specifically from actinobacteria the term organism from greek organismos from organon i e instrument implement tool organ of sense or apprehension first appeared in the english language in and took on its current definition by oxford english dictionary it is directly related to the term organization

senescence s n s ns from latin senescere meaning to grow old from senex or biological aging also spelled biological ageing is the gradual deterioration of function characteristic of most complex lifeforms arguably found in all biological kingdoms that on the level of the organism increases mortality after maturation the word senescence can refer either to cellular senescence or to senescence of the whole organism it is commonly believed that cellular senescence underlies organismal senescence the science of biological aging is biogerontology senescence is not the inevitable fate of all organisms organisms of some taxonomic groups taxa including some animals even experience chronological decrease in mortality for all or part of their life cycle on the other extreme are accelerated aging diseases rare in humans there is also the extremely rare and poorly understood syndrome x whereby a person remains physically and mentally an infant or child throughout one s life even if environmental factors do not cause aging they may affect it in such a way for example overexposure to ultraviolet radiation accelerates skin aging different parts of the body may age at different rates two organisms of the same species can also age at different rates so that biological aging and chronological aging are quite distinct concepts albeit indirectly senescence is by far the leading cause of death other than in the trivially accurate sense that cerebral hypoxia i e lack of oxygen to the brain is the immediate cause of all human death of the roughly people who die each day across the globe about two thirds per day die of age related causes in industrialized nations moreover the proportion is much higher reaching there are a number of hypotheses as to why senescence occurs for example some posit it is programmed by gene expression changes others
in ecosystem predation is a biological interaction where a predator an organism that is hunting feeds on its prey the organism that is attacked predators may or may not kill their prey prior to feeding on them but the act of predation often results in the death of its prey and the eventual absorption of the prey s tissue through consumption thus predation is often though not always carnivory other categories of consumption are herbivory eating parts of plants mycophagy eating parts of fungi and detritivory the consumption of dead organic material detritus all these consumption categories fall under the rubric of consumer resource systems it can often be difficult to separate various types of feeding behaviors for example some parasitic species prey on a host organism and then lay their eggs on it for their offspring to feed on it while it continues to live in or on its decaying corpse after it has died the key characteristic of predation however is the predator s direct impact on the prey population on the other hand detritivores simply eat dead organic material arising from the decay of dead individuals and have no direct impact on the donor organism s selective pressures imposed on one another often leads to an evolutionary arms race between prey and predator resulting in various antipredator adaptations ways of classifying predation surveyed here include grouping by trophic level or diet by specialization and by the nature of the predator s interaction with prey classification of predators by the extent to which they feed on and interact with their prey is one way ecologists may wish to categorize the different types of predation instead of focusing on what they eat this system classifies predators by the way in which they eat and the general nature of the
malnutrition or malnourishment is a condition that results from eating a diet in which nutrients are either not enough or are too much such that the diet causes health problems it may involve calories protein carbohydrates vitamins or minerals not enough nutrients is called undernutrition or undernourishment while too much is called overnutrition malnutrition is often used specifically to refer to undernutrition where there is not enough calories protein or micronutrients if undernutrition occurs during pregnancy or before two years of age it may result in permanent problems with physical and mental development extreme undernourishment known as starvation may have symptoms that include a short height thin body very poor energy levels and swollen legs and abdomen people also often get infections and are frequently cold the symptoms of micronutrient deficiencies depend on the micronutrient that is lacking undernourishment is most often due to not enough high quality food being available to eat this is often related to high food prices and poverty a lack of breastfeeding may contribute as may a number of infectious diseases such as gastroenteritis pneumonia malaria and measles which increase nutrient requirements there are two main types of undernutrition protein energy malnutrition and dietary deficiencies protein energy malnutrition has two severe forms marasmus a lack of protein and calories and kwashiorkor a lack of just protein common micronutrient deficiencies include a lack of iron iodine and vitamin a during pregnancy due to the body s increased need deficiencies may become more common in some developing countries overnutrition in the form of obesity is beginning to present within the same communities as undernutrition other causes of malnutrition include anorexia nervosa and bariatric surgery efforts to improve nutrition are some of the most effective forms of development aid breastfeeding can reduce rates of malnutrition and death in
a disease is a particular abnormal condition a disorder of a structure or function that affects part or all of an organism the causal study of disease is called pathology disease is often construed as a medical condition associated with specific symptoms and signs it may be caused by factors originally from an external source such as infectious disease or it may be caused by internal dysfunctions such as autoimmune diseases in humans disease is often used more broadly to refer to any condition that causes pain dysfunction distress social problems or death to the person afflicted or similar problems for those in contact with the person in this broader sense it sometimes includes injuries disabilities disorders syndromes infections isolated symptoms deviant behaviors and atypical variations of structure and function while in other contexts and for other purposes these may be considered distinguishable categories diseases usually affect people not only physically but also emotionally as contracting and living with a disease can alter one s perspective on life and one s personality death due to disease is called death by natural causes there are four main types of disease pathogenic disease deficiency disease hereditary disease and physiological disease diseases can also be classified as communicable and non communicable the deadliest disease in humans is ischemic heart disease blood flow obstruction followed by cerebrovascular disease and lower respiratory infections respectively in many cases terms such as disease disorder morbidity and illness are used interchangeably there are situations however when specific terms are considered preferable in an infectious disease the incubation period is the time between infection and the appearance of symptoms the latency period is the time between infection and the ability of the disease to spread to another person which may precede follow or be simultaneous with the appearance of
suicide is the act of intentionally causing one s own death suicide is often carried out as a result of despair the cause of which is frequently attributed to a mental disorder such as depression bipolar disorder schizophrenia borderline personality disorder alcoholism or drug abuse as well as stress factors such as financial difficulties troubles with interpersonal relationships and bullying suicide prevention efforts include limiting access to method of suicide such as firearms and poisons treating mental illness and drug misuse and improving economic conditions although crisis hotlines are common there is little evidence for their effectiveness the most commonly used method of suicide varies by country and is partly related to availability common methods include hanging pesticide poisoning and firearms suicide resulted in deaths in this is up from deaths in this makes it the th leading cause of death worldwide rates of completed suicides are higher in men than in women with males three to four times more likely to kill themselves than females there are an estimated to million non fatal attempted suicides every year non fatal suicide attempts may lead to injury and long term disabilities in the western world attempts are more common in young people and are four times more common in females than in males views on suicide have been influenced by broad existential themes such as religion honor and the meaning of life the abrahamic religions traditionally consider suicide an offense towards god due to the belief in the sanctity of life during the samurai era in japan seppuku was respected as a means of atonement for failure or as a form of protest sati a practice outlawed by the british raj expected the indian widow to immolate herself on her husband s funeral pyre either willingly or under pressure from the
note varies by jurisdiction note varies by jurisdiction homicide occurs when one human being causes the death of another human being homicides can be divided into many overlapping types including murder manslaughter justifiable homicide killing in war euthanasia and execution depending on the circumstances of the death these different types of homicides are often treated very differently in human societies some are considered crimes while others are permitted or even ordered by the legal system criminal homicide takes many forms including accidental or purposeful murder the crime committed in a criminal homicide is determined by the mental state of the committing person and the extent of the crime murder for example is usually an intentional crime in many cases homicide may in fact lead to life in prison and or even capital punishment but if the defendant in a capital case is sufficiently mentally disabled in the united states he or she cannot be executed instead the individual is placed under the category of insane in some jurisdictions a homicide that occurs during the commission of a crime may constitute murder regardless of the actor s intent to commit homicide in the united states this is known as the felony murder rule much abbreviated and incomplete the felony murder rule says that one committing a felony may be guilty of murder if someone including the felony victim a bystander or a co felon dies as a result of his acts regardless his intent or lack thereof to kill criminal homicides also include voluntary and involuntary manslaughter an example of voluntary manslaughter is hitting someone with an intent to kill them whereas involuntary manslaughter is unintentionally causing their death the perpetrator does not receive the same legal action against them as a person convicted of murder while most homicides by civilians
starvation is a severe deficiency in caloric energy intake needed to maintain human life it is the most extreme form of malnutrition in humans prolonged starvation can cause permanent organ damage and eventually death the term inanition refers to the symptoms and effects of starvation starvation may also be used as a means of torture or execution according to the world health organization hunger is the single gravest threat to the world s public health the who also states that malnutrition is by far the biggest contributor to child mortality present in half of all cases undernutrition is a contributory factor in the death of million children under five every year figures on actual starvation are difficult to come by but according to the food and agriculture organization the less severe condition of undernourishment currently affects about million people or about one in eight people in the world population the bloated stomach as seen in the picture to the right represents a form of malnutrition called kwashiorkor which is caused by insufficient protein despite a sufficient caloric intake children are more vulnerable to kwashiorkor whose advanced symptoms include weight loss and muscle wasting the basic cause of starvation is an imbalance between energy intake and energy expenditure in other words the body expends more energy than it takes in this imbalance can arise from one or more medical conditions and or circumstantial situations which can include medical reasons circumstantial causes the main causes of starvation are as follows there is insufficient scientific data on exactly how long people can live without food although the length of time obviously varies with an individual s percentage of body fat and general health one medical study estimates that in adults complete starvation leads to death within to weeks there are isolated cases of
dehydration refers to a deficit of total body water with an accompanying disruption of metabolic processes it is also the reason for hypernatremia the term dehydration must be distinguished from hypovolemia loss of blood volume particularly plasma dehydration occurs when free water loss exceeds free water intake usually due to exercise or disease most people can tolerate a three to four percent decrease in total body water without difficulty a five to eight percent decrease can cause fatigue and dizziness over ten percent can cause physical and mental deterioration accompanied by severe thirst a decrease more than fifteen to twenty five percent of the body water is invariably fatal mild dehydration is characterised by thirst and general discomfort and usually resolves with oral rehydration dehydration occurs when water intake is insufficient to replace free water lost due to normal physiologic processes e g breathing or urination and other causes e g diarrhea or vomiting hypovolemia is a related condition specifically meaning a decrease in volume of blood plasma not of total body water both total body water and plasma volume are regulated through independent mechanisms in humans and should not be conflated some authors have reported three types of dehydration based on serum sodium levels hypotonic or hyponatremic referring to this as primarily a loss of electrolytes sodium in particular hypertonic or hypernatremic referring to this as primarily a loss of water and isotonic or isonatremic referring to this as equal loss of water and electrolytes indeed in humans it has been commonly thought that the most commonly seen type of dehydration by far is isotonic isonatraemic dehydration this usage is incorrect and the term isotonic or isonatremic or eunatremic dehydration actually all refer to hypovolemia and should therefore be abandoned in favor of the latter hyponatremic dehydration cannot exist
an accident is an undesirable incidental and unplanned event that could have been prevented had circumstances leading up to the accident been recognized and acted upon prior to its occurrence most scientists who study unintentional injury avoid using the term accident and focus on factors that increase risk of severe injury and that reduce injury incidence and severity robertson physical examples of accidents include unintended motor vehicle collisions or falls being injured by touching something sharp hot electrical or ingesting poison non physical examples are unintentionally revealing a secret or otherwise saying something incorrectly forgetting an appointment etc poisons vehicle collisions and falls are the most common causes of fatal injuries according to a survey of injuries sustained at home which used data from the national vital statistics system of the united states national center for health statistics falls poisoning and fire burn injuries are the most common causes of death the united states also collects statistically valid injury data sampled from hospitals through the national electronic injury surveillance system administered by the consumer product safety commission this program was revised in to include all injuries rather than just injuries involving products data on emergency room visits is also collected through the national health interview survey in the u s the bureau of labor statistics has available on their website extensive statistics on workplace accidents many models to characterize and analyze accidents have been proposed listed and referenced in this reference robertson ls injury epidemiology fourth edition free online at www nanlee net
major trauma is any injury that has the potential to cause prolonged disability or death there are many causes of major trauma blunt and penetrating including falls motor vehicle collisions and gunshot wounds depending on the severity of injury quick management and transport to an appropriate medical facility called a trauma center may be necessary to prevent loss of life or limb the initial assessment involves a physical evaluation and can also include the use of imaging tools to accurately determine a type of injury and to formulate a course of treatment various classification scales exist for use with trauma to determine the severity of injuries which is used to determine the resources used and for statistical collection the initial assessment is critical in determining the extent of injuries and what will be needed to manage an injury and treating immediate life threats in unintentional and intentional injuries were the fifth and seventh leading causes of deaths worldwide accounting for and of all deaths for research purposes the definition is often based on an injury severity score iss of greater than injuries are generally classified by either severity the location of damage or a combination of both trauma may also be classified by demographic group such as age or gender it may also be classified by the type of force applied to the body such as blunt trauma or penetrating trauma for research purposes injury may be classified using the barell matrix which is based on icd cm the purpose of the matrix is to internationally standardize the classification of trauma major trauma is sometimes classified by body area injuries affecting are polytrauma head injuries chest trauma abdominal trauma and extremity trauma various scales exist to provide a quantifiable metric to measure the severity of injuries the value can be
sadness also called heavy heartedness is emotional pain associated with or characterized by feelings of disadvantage loss despair grief helplessness disappointment and sorrow an individual experiencing sadness may become quiet or lethargic and withdraw themselves from others crying is often an indication of sadness sadness is one of the six basic emotions described by paul ekman along with happiness anger surprise fear and disgust sadness is a common experience in childhood acknowledging such emotions can make it much easier for families to address more serious emotional problems although some families may have a conscious or unconscious rule that sadness is not allowed robin skynner has suggested that this may cause problems because with sadness screened off we are left a bit shallow and manic sadness is part of the normal process of the child separating from an early symbiosis with the mother and becoming more independent every time a child separates just a tiny bit more he or she will have to cope with a small loss if the mother cannot allow the minor distress involved the child may never learn how to deal with sadness by themselves pediatrician t berry brazelton argues that too much cheering a child up devalues the emotion of sadness for them and selma fraiberg suggests that it is important to respect a child s right to experience a loss fully and deeply margaret mahler also saw the ability to feel sadness as an emotional achievement as opposed for example to warding it off through restless hyperactivity d w winnicott similarly saw in sad crying the psychological root of valuable musical experiences in later life according to the american journal of psychiatry sadness was found to be associated with increases in bilateral activity within the vicinity of the middle and posterior temporal cortex lateral cerebellum
human bonding is the process of development of a close interpersonal relationship it most commonly takes place between family members or friends but can also develop among groups such as sporting teams and whenever people spend time together bonding is a mutual interactive process and is different from simple liking bonding typically refers to the process of attachment that develops between romantic partners close friends or parents and children this bond is characterized by emotions such as affection and trust any two people who spend time together may form a bond male bonding refers to the establishment of relationships between men through shared activities that often exclude females the term female bonding refers to the formation of close personal relationships between women in the th century bc the greek philosopher plato argued that love directs the bonds of human society in his symposium eryximachus one of the narrators in the dialog states that love goes far beyond simple attraction to human beauty he states that it occurs throughout the animal and plant kingdoms as well as throughout the universe love directs everything that occurs in the realm of the gods as well as that of humans a b eryximachus reasons that when various opposing elements such as wet and dry are animated by the proper species of love they are in harmony with one another but when the sort of love that is crude and impulsive controls the seasons he brings death and destruction a because it is love that guides the relations between these sets of opposites throughout existence in every case it is the higher form of love that brings harmony and cleaves toward the good whereas the impulsive vulgar love creates disharmony plato concludes that the highest form of love is the greatest when love is directed
affection attraction infatuation or fondness is a disposition or rare state of mind or body that is often associated with a feeling or type of love it has given rise to a number of branches of philosophy and psychology concerning emotion disease influence and state of being affection is popularly used to denote a feeling or type of love amounting to more than goodwill or friendship writers on ethics generally use the word to refer to distinct states of feeling both lasting and spasmodic some contrast it with passion as being free from the distinctively sensual element a simple expression of affection through word or deed can have a wide variety of emotional effects that range from joy to discomfort to outright fear in fact affection also has distinct physical effects both for the receiver and the giver more specifically the word has been restricted to emotional states the object of which is a living thing such as a human or animal affection is compared with passion from the greek pathos as such it appears in the writings of french philosopher ren descartes dutch philosopher baruch spinoza and most of the writings of early british ethicists however on various grounds e g that it does not involve anxiety or excitement and that it is comparatively inert and compatible with the entire absence of the sensuous element it is generally and usefully distinguished from passion in this narrower sense the word has played a great part in ethical systems which have spoken of the social or parental affections as in some sense a part of moral obligation for a consideration of these and similar problems which depend ultimately on the degree in which the affections are regarded as voluntary see h sidgwick methods of ethics pp affection can be communicated by

a cadaver also called a corpse in medical literary and legal usage or when intended for dissection is a deceased body observation of the various stages of decomposition can help determine how long a body has been dead the first stage is autolysis more commonly known as self digestion during which the body s cells are destroyed through the action of their own digestive enzymes however these enzymes are released into the cells because of active processes ceasing in the cells not as an active process in other words though autolysis resembles the active process of digestion of nutrients by live cells the dead cells are not actively digesting themselves as is often claimed in popular literature and as the synonym self digestion of autolysis seems to imply as a result of autolysis liquid is created that gets between the layers of skin and makes the skin peel off during this stage flies when present start to lay eggs in the openings of the body eyes nostrils mouth ears open wounds and other orifices hatched larvae maggots of blowflies subsequently get under the skin and start to eat the body the second stage of decomposition is bloating bacteria in the gut begin to break down the tissues of the body releasing gas that accumulates in the intestines which becomes trapped because of the early collapse of the small intestine this bloating occurs largely in the abdomen and sometimes in the mouth and genitals the tongue may swell this usually happens in about the second week of decomposition gas accumulation and bloating will continue until the body is decomposed sufficiently for the gas to escape the third stage is putrefaction it is the last and longest stage putrefaction is where the larger structures of the body break down and tissues liquefy
the skeleton from greek skelet s dried up is the body part that forms the supporting structure of an organism there are two different skeletal types the exoskeleton which is the stable outer shell of an organism and the endoskeleton which forms the support structure inside the body there are also two other forms of skeleton referred to the hydroskeleton and the cytoskeleton exoskeletons are external and are found in many invertebrates they enclose and protect the soft tissues and organs of the body some kinds of exoskeletons undergo periodic moulting as the animal grows as is the case in many arthropods including insects and crustaceans exoskeletons are made of different materials including chitin in arthropods calcium compounds in stony corals and mollusks and silicate for diatoms and radiolarians the exoskeleton of insects is not only a protection but also serves as a surface for muscle attachment as a watertight protection against drying and as a sense organ to interact with their environments the shell of mollusks also performs all of the same functions except that in most cases it does not contain sense organs an external skeleton can be quite heavy in relation to the overall mass of an animal so on land organisms that have an exoskeleton are mostly relatively small somewhat larger aquatic animals can support an exoskeleton because weight is less of a consideration underwater the southern giant clam a species of extremely large saltwater clam in the pacific ocean has a shell that is massive in both size and weight syrinx aruanus is a species of sea snail with a very large shell the endoskeleton is the internal support structure of an animal composed of mineralized tissue and is typical of vertebrates endoskeletons vary in complexity from functioning purely for support as in the case
carrion from the latin caro meaning meat refers to the dead and decaying flesh of an animal carrion is an important food source for large carnivores and omnivores in most ecosystems examples of carrion eaters or scavengers include vultures hawks eagles hyenas virginia opossum tasmanian devils coyotes komodo dragons and burying beetles many invertebrates such as the burying beetles as well as maggots of calliphorid flies and flesh flies also eat carrion playing an important role in recycling nitrogen and carbon in animal remains carrion begins to decay the moment of the animal s death and it will increasingly attract insects and breed bacteria not long after the animal has died its body will begin to exude a foul odor caused by the presence of bacteria and the emission of cadaverine and putrescine some plants and fungi smell like decomposing carrion and attract insects that aid in reproduction plants that exhibit this behavior are known as carrion flowers stinkhorn mushrooms are examples of fungi with this characteristic sometimes carrion is used to describe an infected carcass that is diseased and should not be touched an example of carrion being used to describe dead and rotting bodies in literature may be found in william shakespeare s play julius caesar another example can be found in daniel defoe s robinson crusoe when the title character kills an unknown bird for food but finds its flesh was carrion and fit for nothing the thirty count laws of ulla talmudist include the prohibition of humans consuming carrion this count is in addition to the standard seven law count and has been recently published from the judeo arabic writing of shmuel ben hophni gaon after having been lost for centuries

see text the eurasian magpie or common magpie pica pica is a resident breeding bird throughout europe much of asia and northwest africa it is one of several birds in the crow family named as magpies and belongs to the holarctic radiation of monochrome magpies in europe magpie is used by english speakers as a synonym for the european magpie the only other magpie in europe is the iberian magpie which is limited to the iberian peninsula the eurasian magpie is one of the most intelligent birds and it is believed to be one of the most intelligent of all animals the expansion of its nidopallium is approximately the same in its relative size as the brain of chimpanzees orangutans and humans the magpie was described and illustrated by swiss naturalist conrad gesner in his historiae animalium of in linnaeus included the species in the th edition of his systema naturae under the binomial name corvus pica the magpie was moved to a separate genus pica by the french zoologist mathurin jacques brisson in pica is the classical latin word for a magpie the eurasian magpie is almost identical in appearance to the north american black billed magpie pica hudsonia and at one time the two races were considered to be conspecific in the american ornithologists union decided to treat the black billed magpie as a separate species based on studies of the vocalization and behaviour that indicated that the black billed magpie was closer to the yellow billed magpie pica nuttalli than to the eurasian magpie the gradual clinal variation over the large geographic range and the intergradation of the different races means that the geographical limits and acceptance of the various subspecies varies between authorities the international ornithological congress recognise eleven subspecies the ornithologist steve madge in the
animals are multicellular eukaryotic organisms of the kingdom animalia also called metazoa all animals are motile meaning they can move spontaneously and independently at some point in their lives their body plan eventually becomes fixed as they develop although some undergo a process of metamorphosis later on in their lives all animals are heterotrophs they must ingest other organisms or their products for sustenance most known animal phyla appeared in the fossil record as marine species during the cambrian explosion about million years ago animals are divided into various sub groups some of which are vertebrates birds mammals amphibians reptiles fish molluscs clams oysters octopuses squid snails arthropods millipedes centipedes insects spiders scorpions crabs lobsters shrimp annelids earthworms leeches sponges and jellyfish the word animal comes from the latin word animalis meaning having breath having soul and living beings in everyday non scientific usage the word excludes humans that is animal is often used to refer only to non human members of the kingdom animalia often only closer relatives of humans such as mammals or mammals and other vertebrates are meant the biological definition of the word refers to all members of the kingdom animalia encompassing creatures as diverse as sponges jellyfish insects and humans aristotle divided the living world between animals and plants and this was followed by carl linnaeus in the first hierarchical classification in linnaeus s original scheme the animals were one of three kingdoms divided into the classes of vermes insecta pisces amphibia aves and mammalia since then the last four have all been subsumed into a single phylum the chordata whereas the various other forms have been separated out in ernst haeckel divided the animal kingdom into two subkingdoms metazoa multicellular animals and protozoa single celled animals the protozoa were later moved to the kingdom

biological immortality refers to a stable or decreasing rate of mortality from cellular senescence as a function of chronological age various unicellular and multicellular species may achieve this state either throughout their existence or after living long enough a biologically immortal living being can still die from means other than senescence such as through injury or disease this definition of immortality has been challenged in the new handbook of the biology of aging because the increase in rate of mortality as a function of chronological age may be negligible at extremely old ages an idea referred to as the late life mortality plateau the rate of mortality may cease to increase in old age but in most cases that rate is typically very high as a hypothetical example there is only a chance of a human surviving another year at age or greater the term is also used by biologists to describe cells that are not subject to the hayflick limit biologists chose the word immortal to designate cells that are not subject to the hayflick limit the point at which cells can no longer divide due to dna damage or shortened telomeres prior to leonard hayflick s theory alexis carrel hypothesized that all normal somatic cells were immortal the term immortalization was first applied to cancer cells that expressed the telomere lengthening enzyme telomerase and thereby avoided apoptosis i e cell death caused by intracellular mechanisms among the most commonly used cell lines are hela and jurkat both of which are immortalized cancer cell lines hela cells originated from a sample of cervical cancer taken from henrietta lacks in these cells have been and still are widely used in biological research such as creation of the polio vaccine sex hormone steroid research and cell metabolism normal stem cells and
turritopsis dohrnii the immortal jellyfish is a species of small biologically immortal jellyfish found in the mediterranean sea and in the waters of japan it is the only known case of an animal capable of reverting completely to a sexually immature colonial stage after having reached sexual maturity as a solitary individual like most other hydrozoans t dohrnii begin their life as free swimming tiny larvae known as planula as a planula settles down it gives rise to a colony of polyps that are attached to the sea floor the polyps form into an extensively branched form which is not commonly seen in most jellyfish jellyfish also known as medusae then bud off these polyps and continue their life in a free swimming form eventually becoming sexually mature when sexually mature they have been known to prey on other jellyfish species at a rapid pace all the polyps and jellyfish arising from a single planula are genetically identical clones if a t dohrnii jellyfish is exposed to environmental stress or physical assault or is sick or old it can revert to the polyp stage forming a new polyp colony it does this through the cell development process of transdifferentiation which alters the differentiated state of the cells and transforms them into new types of cells theoretically this process can go on indefinitely effectively rendering the jellyfish biologically immortal although in nature most turritopsis are likely to succumb to predation or disease in the medusa stage without reverting to the polyp form the immortal jellyfish was formerly classified as t nutricula the medusa of turritopsis dohrnii is bell shaped with a maximum diameter of about millimetres in and is about as tall as it is wide the jelly in the walls of the bell is uniformly thin except for some thickening
hydra ha dr is a genus of small fresh water animals of the phylum cnidaria and class hydrozoa native to the temperate and tropical regions biologists are especially interested in hydra because of their regenerative ability they appear not to age or die of old age hydra has a tubular radially symmetric body up to mm in long when extended secured by a simple adhesive foot called the basal disc gland cells in the basal disc secrete a sticky fluid that accounts for its adhesive properties at the free end of t hydras are basically immortal hydra has two main body layers which makes it diploblastic the layers are separated by mesoglea a gel like substance the outer layer is the epidermis and the inner layer is called the gastrodermis because it lines the stomach the cells making up these two body layers are relatively simple hydramacin is a bactericide recently discovered in hydra it protects the outer layer against infection the nervous system of hydra is a nerve net which is structurally simple compared to mammalian nervous systems hydra does not have a recognizable brain or true muscles nerve nets connect sensory photoreceptors and touch sensitive nerve cells located in the body wall and tentacles respiration and excretion occur by diffusion everywhere through the epidermis if hydra are alarmed or attacked the tentacles can be retracted to small buds and the body column itself can be retracted to a small gelatinous sphere hydra generally react in the same way regardless of the direction of the stimulus and this may be due to the simplicity of the nerve net hydra are generally sedentary or sessile but do occasionally move quite readily especially when hunting they do this by bending over and attaching themselves to the substrate with the mouth and
a planarian is one of many flatworms of the turbellaria class it is also the common name for a member of the genus planaria within the family planariidae sometimes it also refers to the genus dugesia planaria are common to many parts of the world living in both saltwater and freshwater ponds and rivers some species are terrestrial and are found under logs in or on the soil and on plants in humid areas some planarians exhibit an extraordinary ability to regenerate lost body parts for example a planarian split lengthwise or crosswise will regenerate into two separate individuals some planarian species have two eye spots also known as ocelli that can detect the intensity of light while others have several eye spots the eye spots act as photoreceptors and are used to move away from light sources planaria have three germ layers ectoderm mesoderm and endoderm and are acoelomate they have a very solid body with no body cavity they have a single opening digestive tract in tricladida planarians this consists of one anterior branch and two posterior branches planarians move by beating cilia on the ventral dermis allowing them to glide along on a film of mucus some also may move by undulations of the whole body by the contractions of muscles built into the body membrane triclads play an important role in watercourse ecosystems and are often very important as bio indicators the most frequently used planarian in high school and first year college laboratories is the brownish girardia tigrina other common species used are the blackish planaria maculata and girardia dorotocephala recently however the species schmidtea mediterranea has emerged as the species of choice for modern molecular biological and genomic research due to its diploid chromosomes and the existence of both asexual and sexual strains recent
physiology f zi l d i from ancient greek physis meaning nature origin and logia meaning study of is the scientific study of the normal function in living systems a sub discipline of biology its focus is in how organisms organ systems organs cells and biomolecules carry out the chemical or physical functions that exist in a living system given the size of the field it is divided into among others animal physiology including that of humans plant physiology cellular physiology microbial physiology see microbial metabolism bacterial physiology and viral physiology nobel prize in physiology or medicine is awarded to those who make significant achievements in this discipline by the royal swedish academy of sciences in medicine a physiologic state is one occurring from normal body function rather than pathologically which is centered on the abnormalities that occur in animal diseases including humans anatomy and physiology which study respectively the structure and function of organisms make a natural pair of related disciplines and they are often studied together physiological studies date back to ancient civilizations of india egypt alongside anatomical studies but did not utilize dissections and vivisection the study of human physiology as a medical field dates back to at least bc to the time of hippocrates also known as the father of medicine hippocrates incorporated his belief system called the theory of humours which consisted of four basic substance earth water air and fire each substance is known for having a corresponding humour black bile phlegm blood and yellow bile respectively hippocrates also noted some emotional connections to the four humours which claudis galenus would later expand on the critical thinking of aristotle and his emphasis on the relationship between structure and function marked the beginning of physiology in ancient greece like hippocrates aristotle took to the humoral
vital signs often shortened to just vitals are used to measure the body s basic functions these measurements are taken to help assess the general physical health of a person give clues to possible diseases and show progress toward recovery the normal ranges for a person s vital signs vary with age weight gender and overall health there are four primary vital signs body temperature blood pressure pulse heart rate and breathing rate respiratory rate often notated as bt bp hr and rr however depending on the clinical setting the vital signs may include other measurements called the fifth vital sign or sixth vital sign vital signs are recorded using the loinc internationally accepted standard coding system early warning scores have been proposed that combine the individual values of vital signs into a single score this was done in recognition that deteriorating vital signs often precede cardiac arrest and or admission to the intensive care unit used appropriately a rapid response team can assess and treat a deteriorating patient and prevent adverse outcomes there are four primary vital signs which are standard in most medical settings the equipment needed is a thermometer a sphygmomanometer and a watch though a pulse can be taken by hand a stethoscope may be required for a patient with a very weak pulse temperature recording gives an indication of core body temperature which is normally tightly controlled thermoregulation as it affects the rate of chemical reactions temperature can be recorded in order to establish a baseline for the individual s normal body temperature for the site and measuring conditions the main reason for checking body temperature is to solicit any signs of systemic infection or inflammation in the presence of a fever temp c f or sustained temp c f or elevated significantly above the
clinical death is the medical term for cessation of blood circulation and breathing the two necessary criteria to sustain human and many other organisms lives it occurs when the heart stops beating in a regular rhythm a condition called cardiac arrest the term is also sometimes used in resuscitation research stopped blood circulation has historically proven irreversible in most cases prior to the invention of cardiopulmonary resuscitation cpr defibrillation epinephrine injection and other treatments in the th century the absence of blood circulation and vital functions related to blood circulation was historically considered the official definition of death with the advent of these strategies cardiac arrest came to be called clinical death rather than simply death to reflect the possibility of post arrest resuscitation for medical purposes it is considered the final physical state before legal death citation needed at the onset of clinical death consciousness is lost within several seconds measurable brain activity stops within to seconds irregular gasping may occur during this early time period and is sometimes mistaken by rescuers as a sign that cpr is not necessary during clinical death all tissues and organs in the body steadily accumulate a type of injury called ischemic injury most tissues and organs of the body can survive clinical death for considerable periods blood circulation can be stopped in the entire body below the heart for at least minutes with injury to the spinal cord being a limiting factor detached limbs may be successfully reattached after hours of no blood circulation at warm temperatures bone tendon and skin can survive as long as to hours the brain however appears to accumulate ischemic injury faster than any other organ without special treatment after circulation is restarted full recovery of the brain after more than minutes of clinical death at normal
legal death is a government s official recognition that a person has died normally this is done by issuing a death certificate in most cases such a certificate is only issued either by a doctor s declaration of death or by an identified corpse in hospitals or other care facilities a doctor or other qualified person legally declares a person dead medical advances have made death more difficult to define in some cases a person will be declared dead even without any remains or doctor s declaration this is under one of two circumstances first if a person was known to be in mortal peril when last seen they can often be declared dead shortly after examples would be the passengers of the titanic that were not rescued after the ship sank second if a person has not been seen for a certain period of time and there has been no evidence that they are alive the amount of time that has passed varies by jurisdiction from as little as four years in the us state of georgia to twenty years in italy in some cases a legal declaration of death is fraudulent several people have faked their own deaths for various reasons the most common reasons for this are to collect insurance money to avoid capture by police or to avoid paying debts people have also been declared legally dead by corrupt governments in uttar pradesh india officials have often been bribed to declare a living person legally dead so that others can steal their land or other property the uttar pradesh association of dead people was founded to help people in this situation determining cause of death often has important legal implications governments appoint a coroner to both determine cause of death and if necessary identify bodies when
the heart is a muscular organ in humans and other animals which pumps blood through the blood vessels of the circulatory system blood provides the body with oxygen and nutrients and also assists in the removal of metabolic wastes the heart is located in the middle compartment of the mediastinum in the chest in humans other mammals and birds the heart is divided into four chambers upper left and right atria and lower left and right ventricles commonly the right atrium and ventricle are referred together as the right heart and their left counterparts as the left heart fish in contrast have two chambers an atrium and a ventricle while reptiles have three chambers in a healthy heart blood flows one way through the heart due to heart valves which prevent backflow the heart is enclosed in a protective sac the pericardium which also contains a small amount of fluid the wall of the heart is made up of three layers epicardium myocardium and endocardium the heart pumps blood through both circulatory systems blood low in oxygen from the systemic circulation enters the right atrium from the superior and inferior vena cavae and passes to the right ventricle from here it is pumped into the pulmonary circulation through the lungs where it receives oxygen and gives off carbon dioxide oxygenated blood then returns to the left atrium passes through the left ventricle and is pumped out through the aorta to the systemic circulation where the oxygen is used and metabolized to carbon dioxide in addition the blood carries nutrients from the liver and gastrointestinal tract to various organs of the body while transporting waste to the liver and kidneys citation needed normally with each heartbeat the right ventricle pumps the same amount of blood into the lungs as the left
the lungs are the primary organs of respiration in humans and many other animals including a few fish and some snails in mammals and most other vertebrates two lungs are located near the backbone on either side of the heart their function in the respiratory system is to extract oxygen from the atmosphere and transfer it into the bloodstream and to release carbon dioxide from the bloodstream into the atmosphere in a process of gas exchange respiration is driven by different muscular systems in different species mammals reptiles and birds use their musculoskeletal systems to support and foster breathing in early tetrapods air was driven into the lungs by the pharyngeal muscles via buccal pumping a mechanism still seen in amphibians in humans the primary muscle that drives breathing is the diaphragm humans have two lungs a right lung and a left lung they are situated within the thoracic cavity of the chest the right lung is bigger than the left lung as the left lung shares space in the chest with the heart the lungs together weigh approximately kilograms lb with the right lung weighing more than the left the lungs are part of the lower respiratory tract that begins at the trachea and branches into the bronchi and bronchioles and which receive air breathed in via the conducting zone these divide until air reaches microscopic alveoli which is where the process of gas exchange takes place together the lungs contain approximately kilometres mi of airways and to million alveoli the lungs are enclosed within a sac called the pleural sac which allows the inner and outer walls to slide over each other whilst breathing takes place without much friction this sac encloses each lung and also divides each lung into sections called lobes the right lung has three
brain death is the complete and irreversible loss of brain function including involuntary activity necessary to sustain life brain death is one of the two ways of determination of death according to the uniform determination of death act of the united states the other way of determining death being irreversible cessation of circulatory and respiratory functions it is differs from persistent vegetative state in which some autonomic functions remain brain death is used as an indicator of legal death in many jurisdictions but it is defined inconsistently various parts of the brain may keep living when others die and the term brain death has been used to refer to various combinations for example although a major medical dictionary says that brain death is synonymous with cerebral death death of the cerebrum the us national library of medicine medical subject headings mesh system defines brain death as including the brainstem the distinctions can be important because for example in someone with a dead cerebrum but a living brainstem the heartbeat and ventilation can continue unaided whereas in whole brain death which includes brain stem death only life support equipment would keep those functions going patients classified as brain dead can have their organs surgically removed for organ donation though not everyone agrees with this practice preferring to limit organ donation to those individuals who have suffered the death of all of their brain and the death of their cardiac and respiratory systems biological or full death however if one limits the criteria to those individuals procuring viable organs can become much more difficult traditionally both the legal and medical communities determined death through the permanent end of certain bodily functions in clinical death especially respiration and heartbeat with the increasing ability of the medical community to resuscitate people with no respiration
science nb is a systematic enterprise that creates builds and organizes knowledge in the form of testable explanations and predictions about the universe nb contemporary science is typically subdivided into the natural sciences which study the material world the social sciences which study people and societies and the formal sciences like mathematics the formal sciences are often excluded as they do not depend on empirical observations disciplines which use science like engineering and medicine may also be considered to be applied sciences from classical antiquity through the th century science as a type of knowledge was more closely linked to philosophy than it is now and in fact in the west the term natural philosophy encompassed fields of study that are today associated with science such as physics astronomy medicine among many others nb in the th and th centuries scientists increasingly sought to formulate knowledge in terms of laws of nature over the course of the th century the word science became increasingly associated with the scientific method itself as a disciplined way to study the natural world it was in the th century that modern scientific disciplines such as physics chemistry and biology reached their modern shapes the same time period also included the origin of the terms scientist and scientific community the founding of scientific institutions and increasing significance of the interactions with society and other aspects of culture science in a broad sense existed before the modern era and in many historical civilizations nb modern science is distinct in its approach and successful in its results modern science now defines what science is in the strictest sense of the term science in its original sense is a word for a type of knowledge rather than a specialized word for the pursuit of such knowledge in particular
medicine british english i m ds n american english i m d s n is the science and practice of the diagnosis treatment and prevention of disease the word medicine is derived from latin medicus meaning a physician medicine encompasses a variety of health care practices evolved to maintain and restore health by the prevention and treatment of illness contemporary medicine applies biomedical sciences biomedical research genetics and medical technology to diagnose treat and prevent injury and disease typically through pharmaceuticals or surgery but also through therapies as diverse as psychotherapy external splints and traction medical devices biologics and ionizing radiation amongst others medicine has existed for thousands of years during most of which it was an art an area of skill and knowledge frequently having connections to the religious and philosophical beliefs of local culture for example a medicine man would apply herbs and say prayers for healing or an ancient philosopher and physician would apply bloodletting according to the theories of humorism in recent centuries since the advent of science most medicine has become a combination of art and science both basic and applied under the umbrella of medical science while stitching technique for sutures is an art learned through practice the knowledge of what happens at the cellular and molecular level in the tissues being stitched arises through science prescientific forms of medicine are now known as traditional medicine and folk medicine they remain commonly used with or instead of scientific medicine and are thus called alternative medicine for example evidence on the effectiveness of acupuncture is variable and inconsistent for any condition but is generally safe when done by an appropriately trained practitioner in contrast treatments outside the bounds of safety and efficacy are termed quackery medical availability and clinical practice varies across the world due

 species stenomys thomas rats are various medium sized long tailed rodents of the superfamily muroidea true rats are members of the genus rattus the most important of which to humans are the black rat rattus rattus and the brown rat rattus norvegicus many members of other rodent genera and families are also referred to as rats and share many characteristics with true rats rats are typically distinguished from mice by their size generally when someone discovers a large muroid rodent its common name includes the term rat while if it is smaller the name includes the term mouse the muroid family is broad and complex and the common terms rat and mouse are not taxonomically specific scientifically the terms are not confined to members of the rattus and mus genera for example the pack rat and cotton mouse the best known rat species are the black rat rattus rattus and the brown rat rattus norvegicus the group is generally known as the old world rats or true rats and originated in asia rats are bigger than most old world mice which are their relatives but seldom weigh over grams lb in the wild the term rat is also used in the names of other small mammals which are not true rats examples include the north american pack rats a number of species loosely called kangaroo rats and others rats such as the bandicoot rat bandicota bengalensis are murine rodents related to true rats but are not members of the genus rattus male rats are called bucks unmated females are called does pregnant or parent females are called dams and infants are called kittens or pups a group of rats is referred to as a mischief the common species are opportunistic survivors and often live with and near humans therefore
an endotherm greek endon within therm heat is an organism that maintains its body at a metabolically favorable temperature largely by the use of heat set free by its internal bodily functions instead of relying almost purely on ambient heat such internally generated heat is mainly an incidental product of the animal s routine metabolism but under conditions of excessive cold or low activity an endotherm might apply special mechanisms adapted specifically to heat production examples include special function muscular exertion such as shivering and uncoupled oxidative metabolism such as within brown adipose tissue mammals and birds are the only extant universally endothermic groups of animals certain lamnid sharks tuna and billfishes are also endothermic in common parlance endotherms are characterized as warm blooded the opposite of endothermy is ectothermy although there is no absolute or clear separation between the nature of endotherms and ectotherms in general many endotherms have a larger number of mitochondria per cell than ectotherms this enables them to generate heat by increasing the rate at which they metabolize fats and sugars accordingly to sustain their higher metabolism endothermic animals typically require several times as much food as ectothermic animals do and usually require a more sustained supply of metabolic fuel in many endothermic animals a controlled temporary state of hypothermia conserves energy by permitting the body temperature to drop nearly to ambient levels such states may be brief regular circadian cycles called torpor or they might occur in much longer even seasonal cycles called hibernation the body temperatures of many small birds e g hummingbirds and small mammals e g tenrecs fall dramatically during daily inactivity such as nightly in diurnal animals or during the day in nocturnal animals thus reducing the energy cost of maintaining body temperature less drastic intermittent reduction in body temperature
breathing is the process that moves air in and out of the lungs or oxygen through other respiratory organs such as gills for organisms with lungs breathing is also called ventilation which includes both inhalation and exhalation breathing is one part of physiological respiration required to sustain life aerobic organisms of birds mammals and reptiles require oxygen to release energy via cellular respiration in the form of the metabolism of energy rich molecules such as glucose breathing is only one of the processes that deliver oxygen to where it is needed in the body and remove carbon dioxide another important process involves the movement of blood by the circulatory system gas exchange occurs in the pulmonary alveoli by passive diffusion of gases between the alveolar gas and the blood in lung capillaries once these dissolved gases are in the blood the heart powers their flow around the body via the circulatory system the medical term for normal relaxed breathing is eupnea in addition to removing carbon dioxide breathing results in loss of water from the body exhaled air has a relative humidity of because of water diffusing across the moist surface of breathing passages and alveoli when a person exhales into very cold outdoor air the moisture laden atmosphere from the lungs becomes chilled to the point where the water condenses into a fog making the exhale visible by anyone in mammals breathing in or inhaling is due to the contraction and flattening of the diaphragm a domed muscle that separates thorax and abdomen if the abdomen is relaxed this contraction causes the abdomen to bulge outwards expanding the volume of the body this increased volume causes a fall in pressure in the thorax which causes the expansion of the lungs when the diaphragm relaxes air leaves largely by elasticity
cardiac arrest also known as cardiopulmonary arrest or circulatory arrest is a sudden stop in effective blood circulation due to the failure of the heart to contract effectively or at all medical personnel may refer to an unexpected cardiac arrest as a sudden cardiac arrest sca a cardiac arrest is different from but may be caused by a myocardial infarction also known as a heart attack where blood flow to the muscle of the heart is impaired it is different from congestive heart failure where circulation is substandard but the heart is still pumping sufficient blood to sustain life arrested blood circulation prevents delivery of oxygen and glucose to the body lack of oxygen and glucose to the brain causes loss of consciousness which then results in abnormal or absent breathing brain injury is likely to happen if cardiac arrest goes untreated for more than five minutes for the best chance of survival and neurological recovery immediate treatment is important cardiac arrest is a medical emergency that in certain situations is potentially reversible if treated early unexpected cardiac arrest can lead to death within minutes this is called sudden cardiac death scd the treatment for cardiac arrest is immediate defibrillation if a shockable rhythm is present while cardiopulmonary resuscitation cpr is used to provide circulatory support and or to induce a shockable rhythm a number of heart conditions and non heart related events can cause cardiac arrest the most common cause is coronary artery disease clinicians classify cardiac arrest into shockable versus non shockable as determined by the ecg rhythm this refers to whether a particular class of cardiac dysrhythmia is treatable using defibrillation the two shockable rhythms are ventricular fibrillation and pulseless ventricular tachycardia while the two non shockable rhythms are asystole and pulseless electrical activity cardiac arrest is
heart rate is the speed of the heartbeat measured by the number of contractions of the heart per unit of time typically beats per minute bpm the heart rate can vary according to the body s physical needs including the need to absorb oxygen and excrete carbon dioxide it is usually equal or close to the pulse measured at any peripheral point activities that can provoke change include physical exercise sleep anxiety stress illness ingesting and drugs the normal resting adult human heart rate ranges from bpm tachycardia is a fast heart rate defined as above bpm at rest bradycardia is a slow heart rate defined as below bpm at rest during sleep a slow heartbeat with rates around bpm is common and is considered normal when the heart is not beating in a regular pattern this is referred to as an arrhythmia these abnormalities of heart rate sometimes indicate disease while heart rhythm is regulated entirely by the sinoatrial node under normal conditions heart rate is regulated by sympathetic and parasympathetic input to the sinoatrial node the accelerans nerve provides sympathetic input to the heart by releasing norepinephrine onto the cells of the sinoatrial node and the vagus nerve provides parasympathetic input to the heart by releasing acetylcholine onto sinoatrial node cells therefore stimulation of the accelerans nerve increases heart rate while stimulation of the vagus nerve decreases it due to individuals having a constant blood volume one of the physiological ways to deliver more oxygen to an organ is to increase heart rate to permit blood to pass by the organ more often normal resting heart rates range from bpm bradycardia is defined as a resting heart rate below bpm however heart rates from to bpm are common among healthy people and do not necessarily require special attention
pallor mortis algor mortis rigor mortis livor mortis putrefaction decomposition skeletonization pallor mortis latin pallor paleness mortis of death is a post mortem paleness that occurs in those with light white skin almost immediately in the minutes immediately post mortem due to a lack of capillary circulation throughout the body the blood sinks down into the lower parts due to gravity of the body creating livor mortis paleness develops so rapidly after death that it has little to no use in determining the time of death aside from saying that it either happened less than minutes ago or more which could help if the body was found very quickly after death a living person can look death pale this can happen when the circumstances make the blood escape from the surface of the skin as in deep shock also heart failure insufficientia cordis can make the face look gray the person then also has blue lips skin can also look death pale as a result of vasoconstriction as part of the body s homeostatic systems in cold conditions or if the skin is deficient in vitamin d as seen in people who spend most of the time indoors away from sunlight

the medical definition of death is a major medical and legal issue and an important issue in declaring a person legally dead the specific criteria used to pronounce legal death are variable and often depend on certain circumstances in order to pronounce a person legally dead controversy is often encountered due to the conflicts between moral and ethical values the increasing demand for organs for organ transplantation is a major focus of concern due to the increasing technological advances in medical equipment these advances are causing further questions on the actual definition of death with so many questions revolving around the issues of legal death declaring a person legally dead in many cases becomes far more than just a medical concern as it involves ethical concerns as well removing organs for organ transplants from a body after death is permitted assuming that the statutory requirements are complied with however with technology constantly increasing in its abilities the question of what can be done to preserve organs is an issue that is highly controversial organs are best preserved when left inside of a living body or beating heart cadaver consequently this raises many issues when dealing with patients who are physically incapable of keeping themselves alive in many cases medical professionals try to keep a person alive for the sole purpose of preserving these organs by doing this future removal of these organs will be more effective in organ transplant patients however this is seen in many ways as violating the rights of the organ donor generally if a patient is unable to give permission for medical treatment they are only allowed to receive treatment if it is found that the treatment would be in their best interest this raises the question of whether keeping a person alive to remove their

time is a measure in which events can be ordered from the past through the present into the future and also the measure of durations of events and the intervals between them time is often referred to as the fourth dimension along with the three spatial dimensions time has long been a major subject of study in religion philosophy and science but defining it in a manner applicable to all fields without circularity has consistently eluded scholars nevertheless diverse fields such as business industry sports the sciences and the performing arts all incorporate some notion of time into their respective measuring systems some simple definitions of time include time is what clocks measure which is a problematically vague and self referential definition that utilizes the device used to measure the subject as the definition of the subject and time is what keeps everything from happening at once which is without substantive meaning in the absence of the definition of simultaneity in the context of the limitations of human sensation observation of events and the perception of such events two contrasting viewpoints on time divide many prominent philosophers one view is that time is part of the fundamental structure of the universe a dimension independent of events in which events occur in sequence sir isaac newton subscribed to this realist view and hence it is sometimes referred to as newtonian time the opposing view is that time does not refer to any kind of container that events and objects move through nor to any entity that flows but that it is instead part of a fundamental intellectual structure together with space and number within which humans sequence and compare events this second view in the tradition of gottfried leibniz and immanuel kant holds that time is neither an event nor a

indian religions also termed as dharmic faiths or religions are the religions that originated in the indian subcontinent namely hinduism jainism buddhism and sikhism web note these religions are also classified as eastern religions although indian religions are connected through the history of india they constitute a wide range of religious communities and are not confined to the indian subcontinent web evidence attesting to prehistoric religion in the indian subcontinent derives from scattered mesolithic rock paintings the harappan people of the indus valley civilisation which lasted from to bce mature period bce was an early urbanised culture which predates the vedic religion the documented history of indian religions begins with the historical vedic religion the religious practices of the early indo iranians which were collected and later redacted into the vedas the period of the composition redaction and commentary of these texts is known as the vedic period which lasted from roughly to bce this religion was closely related to early zoroastrianism and its liturgical language vedic sanskrit was intelligible with avestan the reform period between bce marks a turning point between the vedic religion and hindu religions the shramana movement an ancient indian religious movement parallel to but separate from vedic tradition gave rise to jainism and buddhism and was responsible for the related concepts of yoga sa s ra the cycle of birth and death and moksha liberation from that cycle this period also saw the writing of the upanishads and the rise of vedanta the puranic period bce ce and early medieval period ce gave rise to new configurations of hinduism especially bhakti and shaivism shaktism vaishnavism smarta and much smaller groups like the conservative shrauta the early islamic period ce also gave rise to new movements sikhism was founded in the th century on the teachings
the aim of this page is to describe ways to clarify text there are tags to flag wording that is likely to be confusing to the average reader tags to use when using these templates be specific mark individual phrases sentences and sections in preference to entire articles additionally be sure to leave specific suggestions for improvement on the article s talk page there are some common situations where use of a more specific clarification template might make the desired clarification clearer a common case is an article citing a scientific measurement without indicating how the measurement was taken for example the following statement about solar intensity at the earth s surface without specifying the sun s elevation could be annotated with the following tag
the heart is a muscular organ in humans and other animals which pumps blood through the blood vessels of the circulatory system blood provides the body with oxygen and nutrients and also assists in the removal of metabolic wastes the heart is located in the middle compartment of the mediastinum in the chest in humans other mammals and birds the heart is divided into four chambers upper left and right atria and lower left and right ventricles commonly the right atrium and ventricle are referred together as the right heart and their left counterparts as the left heart fish in contrast have two chambers an atrium and a ventricle while reptiles have three chambers in a healthy heart blood flows one way through the heart due to heart valves which prevent backflow the heart is enclosed in a protective sac the pericardium which also contains a small amount of fluid the wall of the heart is made up of three layers epicardium myocardium and endocardium the heart pumps blood through both circulatory systems blood low in oxygen from the systemic circulation enters the right atrium from the superior and inferior vena cavae and passes to the right ventricle from here it is pumped into the pulmonary circulation through the lungs where it receives oxygen and gives off carbon dioxide oxygenated blood then returns to the left atrium passes through the left ventricle and is pumped out through the aorta to the systemic circulation where the oxygen is used and metabolized to carbon dioxide in addition the blood carries nutrients from the liver and gastrointestinal tract to various organs of the body while transporting waste to the liver and kidneys citation needed normally with each heartbeat the right ventricle pumps the same amount of blood into the lungs as the left
breathing is the process that moves air in and out of the lungs or oxygen through other respiratory organs such as gills for organisms with lungs breathing is also called ventilation which includes both inhalation and exhalation breathing is one part of physiological respiration required to sustain life aerobic organisms of birds mammals and reptiles require oxygen to release energy via cellular respiration in the form of the metabolism of energy rich molecules such as glucose breathing is only one of the processes that deliver oxygen to where it is needed in the body and remove carbon dioxide another important process involves the movement of blood by the circulatory system gas exchange occurs in the pulmonary alveoli by passive diffusion of gases between the alveolar gas and the blood in lung capillaries once these dissolved gases are in the blood the heart powers their flow around the body via the circulatory system the medical term for normal relaxed breathing is eupnea in addition to removing carbon dioxide breathing results in loss of water from the body exhaled air has a relative humidity of because of water diffusing across the moist surface of breathing passages and alveoli when a person exhales into very cold outdoor air the moisture laden atmosphere from the lungs becomes chilled to the point where the water condenses into a fog making the exhale visible by anyone in mammals breathing in or inhaling is due to the contraction and flattening of the diaphragm a domed muscle that separates thorax and abdomen if the abdomen is relaxed this contraction causes the abdomen to bulge outwards expanding the volume of the body this increased volume causes a fall in pressure in the thorax which causes the expansion of the lungs when the diaphragm relaxes air leaves largely by elasticity
cardiopulmonary resuscitation commonly known as cpr is an emergency procedure performed in an effort to manually preserve intact brain function until further measures are taken to restore spontaneous blood circulation and breathing in a person who is in cardiac arrest it is indicated in those who are unresponsive with no breathing or abnormal breathing for example agonal respirations according to the international liaison committee on resuscitation guidelines cpr involves chest compressions for adults between cm in and cm in deep and at a rate of at least to per minute the rescuer may also provide breaths by either exhaling into the subject s mouth or nose or using a device that pushes air into the subject s lungs this process of externally providing ventilation is termed artificial respiration current recommendations place emphasis on high quality chest compressions over artificial respiration a simplified cpr method involving chest compressions only is recommended for untrained rescuers cpr alone is unlikely to restart the heart its main purpose is to restore partial flow of oxygenated blood to the brain and heart the objective is to delay tissue death and to extend the brief window of opportunity for a successful resuscitation without permanent brain damage administration of an electric shock to the subject s heart termed defibrillation is usually needed in order to restore a viable or perfusing heart rhythm defibrillation is effective only for certain heart rhythms namely ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia rather than asystole or pulseless electrical activity cpr may succeed in inducing a heart rhythm that may be shockable in general cpr is continued until the patient has a return of spontaneous circulation rosc or is declared dead or until there is no rescuer physically able to continue cpr can be found exhausting cpr is indicated for any person unresponsive
causality also referred to as causation or cause and effect is the relation between one process the cause and another the effect where the first is understood to be partly responsible for the second in general a process has many causes which are said to be causal factors for it and all lie in its past an effect can in turn be a cause of many other effects which all lie in its future in aristotelian philosophy the word cause is also used to mean explanation or answer to a why question including aristotle s material formal efficient and final causes then the cause is the explanans for the explanandum in this case failure to recognize that different kinds of cause are being considered can lead to futile debate the present article is about aristotle s efficient cause the topic remains a staple in contemporary philosophy aristotle identified four kinds of answer or explanatory mode to various why questions he thought that for any given topic all four kinds of explanatory mode were important each in its own right as a result of traditional specialized philosophical peculiarities of language with translations between ancient greek latin and english the word cause is nowadays in specialized philosophical writings used to label aristotle s four kinds in ordinary language there are various meanings of the word cause the commonest referring to efficient cause the topic of the present article of aristotle s four kinds or explanatory modes only one the efficient cause is a cause as defined in the leading paragraph of this present article the other three explanatory modes might be rendered material composition structure and dynamics and again criterion of completion the word that aristotle used was for the present purpose that greek word would be better translated as explanation than
life support refers to the treatments and techniques performed in an emergency in order to support life after the failure of one or more vital organs healthcare providers and emergency medical technicians are generally certified to perform basic and advanced life support procedures however basic life support is sometimes provided at the scene of an emergency by family members or bystanders before emergency services arrive in the case of cardiac injuries cardiopulmonary resuscitation is initiated by bystanders or family members of the time basic life support techniques such as performing cpr on a victim of cardiac arrest can double or even triple that patient s chance of survival other types of basic life support include relief from choking staunching of bleeding first aid and the use of an automated external defibrillator the purpose of basic life support abbreviated bls is to save lives in a variety of different situations that require immediate attention these situations can include but are not limited to cardiac arrest stroke drowning choking accidental injuries violence severe allergic reactions burns hypothermia birth complications drug overdose and alcohol intoxication the most common emergency that requires bls is cerebral hypoxia a shortage of oxygen to the brain due to heart or respiratory failure a victim of cerebral hypoxia may die within minutes without basic life support procedures bls is the lowest level of emergency care followed by advanced life support and critical care as technology continues to advance within the medical field so do the options available for healthcare out of respect for the patient s autonomy patients and their families are able to make their own decisions about life sustaining treatment or whether to hasten death when patients and their families are forced to make decisions concerning life support as a form of end of life or
organ transplantation is the moving of an organ from one body to another or from a donor site to another location on the person s own body to replace the recipient s damaged or absent organ organs and or tissues that are transplanted within the same person s body are called autografts transplants that are recently performed between two subjects of the same species are called allografts allografts can either be from a living or cadaveric source organs that can be transplanted are the heart kidneys liver lungs pancreas intestine and thymus tissues include bones tendons both referred to as musculoskeletal grafts cornea skin heart valves nerves and veins worldwide the kidneys are the most commonly transplanted organs followed by the liver and then the heart cornea and musculoskeletal grafts are the most commonly transplanted tissues these outnumber organ transplants by more than tenfold organ donors may be living brain dead or dead via circulatory death tissue may be recovered from donors who die of circulatory death as well as of brain death up to hours past the cessation of heartbeat unlike organs most tissues with the exception of corneas can be preserved and stored for up to five years meaning they can be banked transplantation raises a number of bioethical issues including the definition of death when and how consent should be given for an organ to be transplanted and payment for organs for transplantation other ethical issues include transplantation tourism and more broadly the socio economic context in which organ procurement or transplantation may occur a particular problem is organ trafficking some organs such as the brain cannot be transplanted transplantation medicine is one of the most challenging and complex areas of modern medicine some of the key areas for medical management are the problems of transplant rejection
a pacemaker or artificial pacemaker so as not to be confused with the heart s natural pacemaker is a medical device which uses electrical impulses delivered by electrodes contracting the heart muscles to regulate the beating of the heart the primary purpose of a pacemaker is to maintain an adequate heart rate either because the heart s natural pacemaker is not fast enough or because there is a block in the heart s electrical conduction system modern pacemakers are externally programmable and allow a cardiologist to select the optimum pacing modes for individual patients some combine a pacemaker and defibrillator in a single implantable device others have multiple electrodes stimulating differing positions within the heart to improve synchronisation of the lower chambers ventricles of the heart in john alexander macwilliam reported in the british medical journal bmj of his experiments in which application of an electrical impulse to the human heart in asystole caused a ventricular contraction and that a heart rhythm of beats per minute could be evoked by impulses applied at spacings equal to minute in dr mark c lidwill of the royal prince alfred hospital of sydney supported by physicist edgar h booth of the university of sydney devised a portable apparatus which plugged into a lighting point and in which one pole was applied to a skin pad soaked in strong salt solution while the other pole consisted of a needle insulated except at its point and was plunged into the appropriate cardiac chamber the pacemaker rate was variable from about to pulses per minute and likewise the voltage variable from to volts in the apparatus was used to revive a stillborn infant at crown street women s hospital sydney whose heart continued to beat on its own accord at the end of minutes of stimulation
consciousness is the state or quality of awareness or of being aware of an external object or something within oneself it has been defined as sentience awareness subjectivity the ability to experience or to feel wakefulness having a sense of selfhood and the executive control system of the mind despite the difficulty in definition many philosophers believe that there is a broadly shared underlying intuition about what consciousness is as max velmans and susan schneider wrote in the blackwell companion to consciousness anything that we are aware of at a given moment forms part of our consciousness making conscious experience at once the most familiar and most mysterious aspect of our lives western philosophers since the time of descartes and locke have struggled to comprehend the nature of consciousness and pin down its essential properties issues of concern in the philosophy of consciousness include whether the concept is fundamentally coherent whether consciousness can ever be explained mechanistically whether non human consciousness exists and if so how can it be recognized how consciousness relates to language whether consciousness can be understood in a way that does not require a dualistic distinction between mental and physical states or properties and whether it may ever be possible for computing machines like computers or robots to be conscious a topic studied in the field of artificial intelligence thanks to recent developments in technology consciousness has become a significant topic of research in psychology neuropsychology and neuroscience within the past few decades the primary focus is on understanding what it means biologically and psychologically for information to be present in consciousness that is on determining the neural and psychological correlates of consciousness the majority of experimental studies assess consciousness by asking human subjects for a verbal report of their experiences e g tell me if
non rapid eye movement sleep or nrem is collectively sleep stages previously known as stages rapid eye movement sleep rem is not included there are distinct electroencephalographic and other characteristics seen in each stage unlike rem sleep there is usually little or no eye movement during these stages dreaming is rare during nrem sleep and muscles are not paralyzed as in rem sleep people who do not go through the sleeping stages properly get stuck in nrem sleep and because muscles are not paralyzed a person may be able to sleepwalk according to studies the mental activity that takes place during nrem sleep is believed to be thought like whereas rem sleep includes hallucinatory and bizarre content the mental activity that occurs in nrem and rem sleep is a result of two different generators which also explains the difference in mental activity in addition there is a parasympathetic dominance during nrem during the period of non rem sleep the mindset of a person is more organized the differences in the rem and nrem activity reported is believed to arise from differences in the memory stages that happen during the two methods of sleep it has been found through several experiments that low levels of stage sleep are found in about of acute and chronic schizophrenics who typically portray abnormal non rapid eye movement sleep nrem sleep was divided into four stages in the rechtschaffen and kales r k standardization of that has been reduced to three in the update by the american academy of sleep medicine aasm sleep spindles are unique to nrem sleep the most spindle activity occurs at the beginning and the end of nrem sleep spindles involve activation in the brain in the areas of the thalamus anterior cingulate and insular cortices and the superior temporal gyri
in medicine coma from the greek koma meaning deep sleep is a state of unconsciousness in which a person cannot be awakened fails to respond normally to painful stimuli light or sound lacks a normal wake sleep cycle and does not initiate voluntary actions a person in a state of coma is described as being comatose typically a distinction is made in the medical community between a coma and a medically induced coma the former is generally understood to be a result of circumstances beyond the control of the medical community while the latter is generally understood to be a means by which medical professionals may allow a patient s injuries to heal in a controlled environment a comatose person exhibits a complete absence of wakefulness and is unable to consciously feel speak hear or move for a patient to maintain consciousness two important neurological components must function the first is the cerebral cortex the gray matter that forms the outer layer of the brain the other is a structure located in the brainstem called reticular activating system ras injury to either or both of these components is sufficient to cause a patient to experience a coma the cerebral cortex is a group of tight dense gray matter composed of the nuclei of the neurons whose axons then form the white matter and is responsible for perception relay of the sensory input sensation via the thalamic pathway and many other neurological functions including complex thinking ras on the other hand is a more primitive structure in the brainstem that is tightly in connection with reticular formation rf the ras area of the brain has two tracts the ascending and descending tract made up of a system of acetylcholine producing neurons the ascending track or ascending reticular activating system aras works
electroencephalography eeg is an electrophysiological monitoring method to record electrical activity of the brain it is typically noninvasive with the electrodes placed along the scalp although invasive electrodes are sometimes used in specific applications eeg measures voltage fluctuations resulting from ionic current within the neurons of the brain in clinical contexts eeg refers to the recording of the brain s spontaneous electrical activity over a period of time as recorded from multiple electrodes placed on the scalp diagnostic applications generally focus on the spectral content of eeg that is the type of neural oscillations popularly called brain waves that can be observed in eeg signals eeg is most often used to diagnose epilepsy which causes abnormalities in eeg readings it is also used to diagnose sleep disorders coma encephalopathies and brain death eeg used to be a first line method of diagnosis for tumors stroke and other focal brain disorders but this use has decreased with the advent of high resolution anatomical imaging techniques such as magnetic resonance imaging mri and computed tomography ct despite limited spatial resolution eeg continues to be a valuable tool for research and diagnosis especially when millisecond range temporal resolution not possible with ct or mri is required derivatives of the eeg technique include evoked potentials ep which involves averaging the eeg activity time locked to the presentation of a stimulus of some sort visual somatosensory or auditory event related potentials erps refer to averaged eeg responses that are time locked to more complex processing of stimuli this technique is used in cognitive science cognitive psychology and psychophysiological research a routine clinical eeg recording typically lasts minutes plus preparation time and usually involves recording from scalp electrodes routine eeg is typically used in the following clinical circumstances at times a routine eeg is not sufficient
the neocortex latin for new bark or new rind also called the neopallium new mantle and isocortex equal rind is a part of the mammalian brain in the human brain it is the largest part of the cerebral cortex which covers the two cerebral hemispheres with the allocortex making up the rest the neocortex is made up of six layers labelled from the outer in i to vi in humans the neocortex is involved in higher functions such as sensory perception generation of motor commands spatial reasoning conscious thought and language there are two types of cortex in the neocortex the true isocortex and the proisocortex the neocortex is the most developed of the cerebral tissues the neocortex consists of the grey matter or neuronal cell bodies and unmyelinated fibers surrounding the deeper white matter myelinated axons in the cerebrum there are two types of cortex in the neocortex the proisocortex and the true isocortex the pro isocortex is a transitional area between the true isocortex and the periallocortex part of the allocortex it is found in the cingulate cortex part of the limbic system in brodmann s areas and the insula and the parahippocampal gyrus the neocortex is smooth in rodents and other small mammals whereas in primates and other larger mammals it has deep grooves sulci and ridges gyri these folds allow the surface area of the neocortex to increase far beyond what could otherwise be fit in the same size skull all human brains have the same overall pattern of main gyri and sulci although they differ in detail from one person to another the mechanism by which the gyri form during embryogenesis is not entirely clear and there are several competing hypotheses that explain gyrification axonal tension cortical buckling or differences in cellular proliferation rates in
cognition is the set of all mental abilities and processes related to knowledge attention memory and working memory judgment and evaluation reasoning and computation problem solving and decision making comprehension and production of language etc human cognition is conscious and unconscious concrete or abstract as well as intuitive like knowledge of a language and conceptual like a model of a language cognitive processes use existing knowledge and generate new knowledge the processes are analyzed from different perspectives within different contexts notably in the fields of linguistics anesthesia neuroscience psychiatry psychology education philosophy anthropology biology systemics logic and computer science page needed these and other different approaches to the analysis of cognition are synthesised in the developing field of cognitive science a progressively autonomous academic discipline within psychology and philosophy the concept of cognition is closely related to abstract concepts such as mind and intelligence it encompasses the mental functions mental processes thoughts and states of intelligent entities humans collaborative groups human organizations highly autonomous machines and artificial intelligences thus the term s usage varies across disciplines for example in psychology and cognitive science cognition usually refers to an information processing view of an individual s psychological functions it is also used in a branch of social psychology called social cognition to explain attitudes attribution and group dynamics in cognitive psychology and cognitive engineering cognition is typically assumed to be information processing in a participant s or operator s mind or brain cognition can in some specific and abstract sense also be artificial the word cognition comes from the latin verb cognosco con with and gn sc know itself a cognate of the greek verb gi g n sko meaning i know perceive noun gn sis knowledge meaning to conceptualize or to recognize cognition is a word that dates back to
the cerebral cortex is the cerebrum s brain outer layer of neural tissue in humans and other mammals it is divided into two cortices along the sagittal plane the left and right cerebral hemispheres divided by the medial longitudinal fissure the cerebral cortex plays a key role in memory attention perception awareness thought language and consciousness the human cerebral cortex is to millimetres to in thick in large mammals the cerebral cortex is folded giving a much greater surface area in the confined volume of the skull a fold or ridge in the cortex is termed a gyrus plural gyri and a groove or fissure is termed a sulcus plural sulci in the human brain more than two thirds of the cerebral cortex is buried in the sulci the cerebral cortex is gray matter consisting mainly of cell bodies with astrocytes being the most abundant cell type in the cortex as well as the human brain as a whole and capillaries it contrasts with the underlying white matter consisting mainly of the white myelinated sheaths of neuronal axons the phylogenetically most recent part of the cerebral cortex the neocortex also called isocortex is differentiated into six horizontal layers the more ancient part of the cerebral cortex the hippocampus has at most three cellular layers neurons in various layers connect vertically to form small microcircuits called cortical columns different neocortical regions known as brodmann areas are distinguished by variations in their cytoarchitectonics histological structure and functional roles in sensation cognition and behavior the different cortical layers each contain a characteristic distribution of neuronal cell types and connections with other cortical and subcortical regions there are direct connections between different cortical areas and indirect connections via the thalamus for example one of the clearest examples of cortical layering is the stria of
personality psychology is a branch of psychology that studies personality and its variation among individuals its areas of focus include personality is a dynamic and organized set of characteristics possessed by a person that uniquely influences their environment cognitions emotions motivations and behavioral science in various situations the word personality originates from the latin persona which means mask personality also refers to the pattern of thoughts feelings social adjustments and behaviors consistently exhibited over time that strongly influences one s expectations self perceptions values and attitudes it also predicts human reactions to other people problems and stress there is still no universal consensus on the definition of personality in psychology gordon allport described two major ways to study personality the nomothetic and the idiographic nomothetic psychology seeks general laws that can be applied to many different people such as the principle of self actualization or the trait of extraversion idiographic psychology is an attempt to understand the unique aspects of a particular individual the study of personality has a broad and varied history in psychology with an abundance of theoretical traditions the major theories include dispositional trait perspective psychodynamic humanistic biological behaviorist evolutionary and social learning perspective however many researchers and psychologists do not explicitly identify themselves with a certain perspective and instead take an eclectic approach research in this area is empirically driven such as dimensional models based on multivariate statistics such as factor analysis or emphasizes theory development such as that of the psychodynamic theory there is also a substantial emphasis on the applied field of personality testing in psychological education and training the study of the nature of personality and its psychological development is usually reviewed as a prerequisite to courses in abnormal psychology or clinical psychology many of the ideas developed by historical and modern personality
