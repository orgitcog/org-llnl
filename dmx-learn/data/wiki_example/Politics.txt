meritocracy merit from latin mere i earn and cracy from ancient greek kratos strength power is a political philosophy which holds that power should be vested in individuals almost exclusively according to merit advancement in such a system is based on performance measured through examination and or demonstrated achievement in the field where it is implemented the most common definition of meritocracy conceptualizes merit in terms of tested competency and ability and most likely as measured by iq or standardized achievement tests in government or other administration systems meritocracy in an administrative sense is a system of government or other administration such as business administration wherein appointments and responsibilities are assigned to individuals based upon their merits namely intelligence credentials and education determined through evaluations or examinations in a more general sense meritocracy can refer to any form of government based on achievement like utilitarian and pragmatic the word meritocratic has also developed a broader definition and may be used to refer to any government run by a ruling or influential class of educated or able people this is in contrast to the original condemnatory use of the term by michael young in who defined it as a system where merit is equated with intelligence plus effort its possessors are identified at an early age and selected for appropriate intensive education and there is an obsession with quantification test scoring and qualifications meritocracy in its wider sense may be any general act of judgment upon the basis of various demonstrated merits such acts frequently are described in sociology and psychology supporters of meritocracies do not necessarily agree on the nature of merit however they do tend to agree that merit itself should be a primary consideration during evaluation thus the merits may extend beyond intelligence and education to any mental
a monarchy is a form of government in which sovereignty is actually or nominally embodied in one or several individual s reigning until death or abdication they are called the monarchs forms of monarchy differ widely based on the level of legal autonomy the monarch holds in governance the method of selection of the monarch and any predetermined limits on the length of their tenure when the monarch has no or few legal restraints in state and political matters it is called an absolute monarchy and is a form of autocracy cases in which the monarch s discretion is formally limited are called constitutional monarchies in hereditary monarchies the office is passed through inheritance within a family group whereas elective monarchies use some system of voting each of these has variations in some elected monarchies only those of certain pedigrees are eligible whereas many hereditary monarchies impose requirements regarding the religion age gender mental capacity and other factors occasionally this might create a situation of rival claimants whose legitimacy is subject to effective election finally there have been cases where the term of a monarch s reign is either fixed in years or continues until certain goals are achieved an invasion being repulsed for instance thus there are widely divergent structures and traditions defining monarchy monarchy was the most common form of government until the th century but it is no longer prevalent where it exists it is now usually a constitutional monarchy in which the monarch retains a unique legal and ceremonial role but exercises limited or no official political power under the written or unwritten constitution others have governing authority currently sovereign nations in the world have monarchs acting as heads of state of which are commonwealth realms that recognise queen elizabeth ii as their head of state
a parliamentary system is a system of democratic governance of a state in which the executive branch derives its democratic legitimacy from and is held accountable to the legislature parliament the executive and legislative branches are thus interconnected in a parliamentary system the head of state is normally a different person from the head of government this is in contrast to a presidential system in a democracy where the head of state often is also the head of government and most importantly the executive branch does not derive its democratic legitimacy from the legislature countries with parliamentary systems may be constitutional monarchies where a monarch is the ceremonial head of state while the head of government is almost always a member of the legislature such as the united kingdom sweden and japan or parliamentary republics where a mostly ceremonial president is the head of state while the head of government is regularly from the legislature such as ireland germany pakistan india and italy in a few parliamentary republics such as botswana south africa and suriname as well as german states the head of government is also head of state but is elected by and is answerable to the legislature the modern concept of prime ministerial government originated in the kingdom of great britain and its contemporary the parliamentary system in sweden in prince elector george ludwig of hanover germany acceded to the throne of great britain after his cousin queen anne died with no heirs of her body as king george i he chaired the cabinet and chose ministers of the government however he initially spoke no english this shifted the balance of power towards the leading minister or first minister who de facto chaired the cabinet during his reign parliament s role in controlling government and in deciding who
a presidential system is a system of government where a head of government is also head of state and leads an executive branch that is separate from the legislative branch the united states for instance has a presidential system the executive is elected and often titled president and is not responsible to the legislature and cannot in normal circumstances dismiss it the legislature may have the right in extreme cases to dismiss the executive often through impeachment however such dismissals are seen as so rare as not to contradict a central tenet of presidentialism that in normal circumstances using normal means the legislature cannot dismiss the executive the title president has persisted from a time when such person personally presided over the government body as with the us president of the continental congress before the executive function was split into a separate branch of government and could no longer preside over the legislative body presidential systems are numerous and diverse but the following are generally true countries that feature a presidential system of government are not the exclusive users of the title of president for example a dictator who may or may not have been popularly or legitimately elected may be and often is called a president likewise leaders of one party states are often called presidents most parliamentary republics have presidents but this position is largely ceremonial notable examples include germany india ireland israel and italy the title is also used in parliamentary republics with an executive presidency and also in semi presidential systems in a full fledged presidential system a president is chosen directly by the people or indirectly by the winning party to be the head of the executive branch presidential governments make no distinction between the positions of head of state and head of government both
semi presidentialism is a system of government in which a president exists along with a prime minister and a cabinet with the latter two being responsible to the legislature of a state it differs from a parliamentary republic in that it has a popularly elected head of state who is more than a purely ceremonial figurehead and from the presidential system in that the cabinet although named by the president is responsible to the legislature which may force the cabinet to resign through a motion of no confidence while the german weimar republic exemplified an early semi presidential system the term semi presidential originated in a work by political scientist maurice duverger to describe the french fifth republic established in which duverger dubbed a r gime semi pr sidentiel there are two separate subtypes of semi presidentialism premier presidentialism and president parliamentarism under the premier presidential system the prime minister and cabinet are exclusively accountable to parliament the president chooses the prime minister and cabinet but only the parliament may remove them from office with a vote of no confidence the president does not have the right to dismiss the prime minister or the cabinet however in some variations of it the president can circumvent this limitation by exercising the discretionary power of dissolving the assembly which forces the prime minister and cabinet to step down this subtype is used in burkina faso georgia since france madagascar mali mongolia niger poland portugal romania senegal and ukraine since previously between and under the president parliamentary system the prime minister and cabinet are dually accountable to the president and the assembly majority the president chooses the prime minister and the cabinet but must have the support of the parliament majority for his choice in order to remove a prime minister or the

international relations theory is the study of international relations from a theoretical perspective it attempts to provide a conceptual framework upon which international relations can be analyzed ole holsti describes international relations theories as acting like pairs of coloured sunglasses that allow the wearer to see only salient events relevant to the theory e g an adherent of realism may completely disregard an event that a constructivist might pounce upon as crucial and vice versa the three most popular theories are realism liberalism and constructivism international relations theories can be divided into positivist rationalist theories which focus on a principally state level analysis and post positivist reflectivist ones which incorporate expanded meanings of security ranging from class to gender to postcolonial security many often conflicting ways of thinking exist in ir theory including constructivism institutionalism marxism neo gramscianism and others however two positivist schools of thought are most prevalent realism and liberalism though increasingly constructivism is becoming mainstream the study of international relations as theory can be traced to e h carr s the twenty years crisis which was published in and to hans morgenthau s politics among nations published in international relations as a discipline is believed to have emerged after the first world war with the establishment of a chair of international relations at the university of wales aberystwyth early international relations scholarship in the interwar years focused on the need for the balance of power system to be replaced with a system of collective security these thinkers were later described as idealists the leading critique of this school of thinking was the realist analysis offered by carr however a more recent study by david long and brian schmidt in offers a revisionist account of the origins of the field international relations they claim that the history of
comparative politics is a field and a method used in political science characterized by an empirical approach based on the comparative method in other words comparative politics is the study of the domestic politics political institutions and conflicts of countries it often involves comparisons among countries and through time within single countries emphasizing key patterns of similarity and difference arend lijphart argues that comparative politics does not have a substantive focus in itself but rather a methodological one it focuses on the how but does not specify the what of the analysis in other words comparative politics is not defined by the object of its study but rather by the method it applies to study political phenomena peter mair and richard rose advance a slightly different definition arguing that comparative politics is defined by a combination of a substantive focus on the study of countries political systems and a method of identifying and explaining similarities and differences between these countries using common concepts rose states that on his definition the focus is explicitly or implicitly upon more than one country thus following familiar political science usage in excluding within nation comparison methodologically comparison is distinguished by its use of concepts that are applicable in more than one country when applied to specific fields of study comparative politics may be referred to by other names such as for example comparative government the comparative study of forms of government or comparative foreign policy comparing the foreign policies of different states in order to establish general empirical connections between the characteristics of the state and the characteristics of its foreign policy sometimes especially in the united states the term comparative politics is used to refer to the politics of foreign countries this usage of the term however is often considered incorrect comparative political

a bureaucracy bju r kr si is a body of non elective government officials and or an administrative policy making group historically bureaucracy was government administration managed by departments staffed with nonelected officials today bureaucracy is the administrative system governing any large institution since being coined the word bureaucracy has developed negative connotations bureaucracies have been criticized as being too complex inefficient or too inflexible the dehumanizing effects of excessive bureaucracy became a major theme in the work of franz kafka and were central to his novels the castle and the trial the elimination of unnecessary bureaucracy is a key concept in modern managerial theory and has been an issue in some political campaigns others have defended the necessity of bureaucracies the german sociologist max weber argued that bureaucracy constitutes the most efficient and rational way in which one can organize human activity and that systematic processes and organized hierarchies were necessary to maintain order maximize efficiency and eliminate favoritism weber also saw unfettered bureaucracy as a threat to individual freedom in which an increase in the bureaucratization of human life can trap individuals in an iron cage of rule based rational control the term bureaucracy is french in origin and combines the french word bureau desk or office with the greek word kratos rule or political power it was coined in the mid th century by the french economist jacques claude marie vincent de gournay and was a satirical pejorative from the outset gournay never wrote the term down but was later quoted at length in a letter from a contemporary the first known english language use dates to here too the sense was pejorative with irish novelist lady morgan referring to the bureaucratie or office tyranny by which ireland has so long been governed by the mid th
street level bureaucracy is the subset of a public agency or government institution containing the individuals who carry out and enforce the actions required by laws and public policies street level bureaucracy is accompanied by the idea that these individuals vary the extents to which they enforce the rules and laws assigned to them the concept of street level bureaucracy was first coined by michael lipsky in who argued that policy implementation in the end comes down to the people who actually implement it however the process of street level bureaucracy has been around for a much longer period of time as stated in scott a cook and william earle klay s article on precedents of george washington a government will be better accepted if its administrators reflect the origins of its people which embodies what street level bureaucracy in america some of the first street level bureaucrats in the nation were post office officials the presidency of woodrow wilson helped to spur a large growth in public administration and government policy which in turn transmitted to larger sized street level bureaucracies however it was not until the s with the baby boom that street level bureaucracy as michael lipsky stated became as strong as a presence in society as it today lipsky describes street level bureaucrats as the face of policy since these individuals interact directly with citizens the history of street level bureaucracy follows the history of policy development and the scope of government in america with areas with larger populations and more government policies employing more individuals such as chicago which employs teachers due to in depth interactions day to day discretion and policy interpretation lipsky claims that in a sense the street level bureaucrats implicitly mediate aspects of the constitutional relationship of citizens to the state
adhocracy is a flexible adaptable and informal form of organization that is defined by a lack of formal structure it operates in an opposite fashion to a bureaucracy the term was first coined by warren bennis in his book the temporary society later popularized in by alvin toffler in future shock and has since become often used in the theory of management of organizations particularly online organizations citation needed the concept has been further developed by academics such as henry mintzberg adhocracy is characterized by an adaptive creative and flexible integrative behavior based on non permanence and spontaneity it is believed that these characteristics allow adhocracy to respond faster than traditional bureaucratic organizations while being more open to new ideas robert h waterman jr defined adhocracy as any form of organization that cuts across normal bureaucratic lines to capture opportunities solve problems and get results for henry mintzberg an adhocracy is a complex and dynamic organizational form it is different from bureaucracy like toffler mintzberg considers bureaucracy a thing of the past and adhocracy one of the future when done well adhocracy can be very good at problem solving and innovations and thrives in a diverse environment it requires sophisticated and often automated technical systems to develop and thrive all members of an organization have the authority within their areas of specialization and in coordination with other members to make decisions and to take actions affecting the future of the organization there is an absence of hierarchy according to robert h waterman jr teams should be big enough to represent all parts of the bureaucracy that will be affected by their work yet small enough to get the job done efficiently alvin toffler claimed in his book future shock that adhocracies will get more common and are likely to replace
a policy is a deliberate system of principles to guide decisions and achieve rational outcomes a policy is a statement of intent and is implemented as a procedure or protocol policies are generally adopted by the board of or senior governance body within an organization whereas procedures or protocols would be developed and adopted by senior executive officers policies can assist in both subjective and objective decision making policies to assist in subjective decision making would usually assist senior management with decisions that must consider the relative merits of a number of factors before making decisions and as a result are often hard to objectively test e g work life balance policy in contrast policies to assist in objective decision making are usually operational in nature and can be objectively tested e g password policy the term may apply to government private sector organizations and groups as well as individuals presidential executive orders corporate privacy policies and parliamentary rules of order are all examples of policy policy differs from rules or law while law can compel or prohibit behaviors e g a law requiring the payment of taxes on income policy merely guides actions toward those that are most likely to achieve a desired outcome citation needed policy or policy study may also refer to the process of making important organizational decisions including the identification of different alternatives such as programs or spending priorities and choosing among them on the basis of the impact they will have policies can be understood as political management financial and administrative mechanisms arranged to reach explicit goals in public corporate finance a critical accounting policy is a policy for a firm company or an industry which is considered to have a notably high subjective element and that has a material impact on the financial

 further explanation needed in private international law the public policy doctrine or ordre public concerns the body of principles that underpin the operation of legal systems in each state this addresses the social moral and economic values that tie a society together values that vary in different cultures and change over time law regulates behaviour either to reinforce existing social expectations or to encourage constructive change and laws are most likely to be effective when they are consistent with the most generally accepted societal norms and reflect the collective morality of the society in performing this function cappalli has suggested that the critical values of any legal system include impartiality neutrality certainty equality openness flexibility and growth this assumes that a state s courts function as dispute resolution systems which avoid the violence that often otherwise accompanies private resolution of disputes that is citizens have to be encouraged to use the court system to resolve their disputes the more certain and predictable the outcome of a court action the less incentive there is to go to court where a loss is probable but certainty must be subject to the needs of individual justice hence the development of equity a judge should always consider the underlying policies to determine whether a rule should be applied to a specific factual dispute if laws are applied too strictly and mechanically the law cannot keep pace with social innovation similarly if there is an entirely new situation a return to the policies forming the basic assumptions underpinning potentially relevant rules of law identifies the best guidelines for resolving the immediate dispute over time these policies evolve becoming more clearly defined and more deeply embedded in the legal system the fundamental policy in the operation of a legal system is that ignorantia juris non
public interest according to the random house dictionary is the welfare or well being of the general public commonwealth appeal or relevance to the general populace a news story of public interest economist lok sang ho in his public policy and the public interest routledge published argues that the public interest must be assessed impartially and therefore defines the public interest as the ex ante welfare of the representative individual under a thought experiment by assuming that there is an equal chance for one to be anyone in society and thus could benefit or suffer from a change the public interest is by definition enhanced whenever that change is preferred to the status quo ex ante this approach is ex ante in the sense that the change is not evaluated after the fact but assessed before the fact without knowing whether one would actually benefit or suffer from it this approach follows the veil of ignorance approach which was first proposed by john harsanyi but popularized by john rawls in his theory of justice historically however the approach can be traced to john stuart mill who in his letter to george grote explained that human happiness even one s own is in general more successfully pursued by acting on general rules than by measuring the consequences of each act and this is still more the case with the general happiness since any other plan would not only leave everybody uncertain what to expect but would involve perpetual quarrelling the institute of chartered accountants in england and wales argues that applying a detailed definition is likely to result in unintended consequences in acting in the public interest instead each circumstance needs to be assessed based on criteria such as the relevant public wants and constraints the key to assessing any public

the separation of powers often imprecisely used interchangeably with the trias politica principle is a model for the governance of a state or who controls the state the model was first developed in ancient greece under this model the state is divided into branches each with separate and independent powers and areas of responsibility so that the powers of one branch are not in conflict with the powers associated with the other branches the typical division of branches is into a legislature an executive and a judiciary it can be contrasted with the fusion of powers in a parliamentary system where the executive and legislature and sometimes parts of the judiciary are unified aristotle first mentioned the idea of a mixed government or hybrid government in his work politics where he drew upon many of the constitutional forms in the city states of ancient greece in the roman republic the roman senate consuls and the assemblies showed an example of a mixed government according to polybius histories book john calvin favoured a system of government that divided political power between democracy and aristocracy mixed government calvin appreciated the advantages of democracy stating it is an invaluable gift if god allows a people to elect its own government and magistrates in order to reduce the danger of misuse of political power calvin suggested setting up several political institutions which should complement and control each other in a system of checks and balances in this way calvin and his followers resisted political absolutism and furthered the growth of democracy calvin aimed to protect the rights and the well being of ordinary people need quotation to verify in a group of english separatist congregationalists and anglicans later known as the pilgrim fathers founded plymouth colony in north america enjoying self rule they established

sovereignty is understood in jurisprudence as the full right and power of a governing body to govern itself without any interference from outside sources or bodies in political theory sovereignty is a substantive term designating supreme authority over some polity it is a basic principle underlying the dominant westphalian model of state foundation derived from latin through french souverainet its attainment and retention in both chinese and western culture has traditionally been associated with certain moral imperatives upon any claimant the concept of sovereignty has been discussed throughout history from the time before recorded history through to the present day it has changed in its definition concept and application throughout especially during the age of enlightenment the current notion of state sovereignty contains four aspects consisting of territory population authority and recognition according to stephen d krasner the term could also be understood in four different ways often these four aspects all appear together but this is not necessarily the case they are not affected by one another and there are historical examples of states that were non sovereign in one aspect while at the same time being sovereign in another of these aspects according to immanuel wallerstein another fundamental feature of sovereignty is that it is a claim that must be recognised by others if it is to have any meaning sovereignty is more than anything else a matter of legitimacy that requires reciprocal recognition sovereignty is a hypothetical trade in which two potentially conflicting sides respecting de facto realities of power exchange such recognitions as their least costly strategy the roman jurist ulpian observed that ulpian was expressing the idea that the emperor exercised a rather absolute form of sovereignty although he did not use the term expressly classical ulpian s statements were known in medieval europe but
theories of political behavior as an aspect of political science attempt to quantify and explain the influences that define a person s political views ideology and levels of political participation theorists who have had an influence on this field include karl deutsch and theodor adorno there are three main sources of influence that shape political orientation which creates long term effects generally the primary influence originates from family as stated previously children will often adopt their parents ideological values some theorists have argued that family tends to be the strongest most influential force which exists over the lifetime one essay has credited the majority of the student activism of the s to the influence of parents secondly teachers and other educational authority figures have a significant impact on political orientation from as early as age up until children spend about of their time involved in educational processes citation needed post secondary education significantly raises the impact of political awareness and orientation an october study of college undergraduates across the united states showed that of college students were registered to vote compared to a national average of of american adults a study at santa clara university also showed that of students there were registered to vote also consider that childhood and adolescent stages of personal growth have the highest level of impressionability thirdly peers also affect political orientation friends often but not necessarily have the advantage of being part of the same generation which collectively develops a unique set of societal issues eric l dey has argued that socialisation is the process through which individuals acquire knowledge habits and value orientations that will be useful in the future the ability to relate on this common level is where the means to shape ideological growth short term factors also affect voting behavior
political psychology is an interdisciplinary academic field dedicated to understanding politics politicians and political behavior from a psychological perspective the relationship between politics and psychology is considered bi directional with psychology being used as a lens for understanding politics and politics being used as a lens for understanding psychology as an interdisciplinary field political psychology borrows from a wide range of other disciplines including anthropology sociology international relations economics philosophy media journalism and history political psychology aims to understand interdependent relationships between individuals and contexts that are influenced by beliefs motivation perception cognition information processing learning strategies socialization and attitude formation political psychological theory and approaches have been applied in many contexts such as leadership role domestic and foreign policy making behavior in ethnic violence war and genocide group dynamics and conflict racist behavior voting attitudes and motivation voting and the role of the media nationalism and political extremism in essence political psychologists study the foundations dynamics and outcomes of political behavior using cognitive and social explanations political psychology originated in western europe where it was closely tied to the emergence of new disciplines and paradigms as well as to the precise social and political context in various countries the discipline political psychology was formally introduced during the franco prussian war and the socialist revolution stirred by the rise of the paris commune the term political psychology was first introduced by the ethnologist adolph bastian in his book man in history the philosopher hippolyte taine a founder of the ecole libre de sciences politiques applied bastian s theories in his works the origins of contemporary france to ideas on the founding and development of the third republic the head of ecole libre de sciences politiques emile boutmy was a famous explorer of social political and geographical concepts of national interactions
a number of studies have found that biology may be linked with political orientation this means that biology is a possible factor in political orientation but may also mean that the ideology a person identifies with changes a person s ability to perform certain tasks recent research points at substantial differences in the cognitive styles of liberals and conservatives on psychological measures for example conservatives respond to threatening situations with more aggression than do liberals similarly conservatives are more sensitive to threatening facial expressions jost and colleagues posed that political orientation is associated with psychological processes for managing fear and uncertainty a study by cognitive neuroscientist ryota kanai s group at university college london published in current biology found a correlation between differences in political views and differences in brain structures in a convenience sample of students from university college london the researchers performed mri scans on the brains of volunteer students who had indicated their political orientation on a five point scale ranging from very liberal to very conservative students who reported more conservative political views tended to have larger amygdalae a structure in the temporal lobes that performs a primary role in the processing and memory of emotions in addition they found clusters in which gray matter volume was significantly associated with conservativism in the left insula and the right entorhinal cortex there is evidence that conservatives are more sensitive to disgust and the insula is involved in the feeling of disgust on the other hand more liberal students tended to have a larger volume of grey matter in the anterior cingulate cortex a structure of the brain associated with monitoring uncertainty and handling conflicting information it is consistent with previous research suggesting that individuals with a larger acc have a higher capacity to tolerate uncertainty and conflicts

an autocracy is a system of government in which supreme power is concentrated in the hands of one person whose decisions are subject to neither external legal restraints nor regularized mechanisms of popular control except perhaps for the implicit threat of a coup d tat or mass insurrection absolute monarchy and dictatorship are the main historical forms of autocracy in the medieval greek language the term autocrates was used for anyone holding the title emperor regardless of the actual power of the monarch some historical slavic monarchs such as russian czars and emperors included the title autocrat as part of their official styles distinguishing them from the constitutional monarchs elsewhere in europe both totalitarianism and military dictatorship are often identified with but need not be an autocracy totalitarianism is a system where the state strives to control every aspect of life and civil society it can be headed by a supreme dictator making it autocratic but it can also have a collective leadership such as a commune junta or single political party in an analysis of militarized disputes between two states if one of the states involved was an autocracy the chance of violence occurring doubled because autocrats need a power structure to rule it can be difficult to draw a clear line between historical autocracies and oligarchies most historical autocrats depended on their nobles the military the priesthood or other elite groups some autocracies are rationalized by assertion of divine right
despotism is a form of government in which a single entity rules with absolute power that entity may be an individual as in an autocracy or it may be a group as in an oligarchy the word despotism means to rule in the fashion of a despot and does not necessarily require a singular despot an individual despot comes from the greek despotes which roughly means master or one with power and it has been used to translate a wide variety of titles and positions it was used to describe the unlimited power and authority of the pharaohs of egypt employed in the byzantine court as a title of nobility used by the rulers of byzantine vassal states and adopted as a title of the byzantine emperors thus despot is found to have different meanings and interpretations at various times in history and cannot be described by a single definition this is similar to the other greek titles basileus and autokrator which along with despot have been used at various times to describe everything from a local chieftain to a simple ruler king or emperor colloquially despot has been applied pejoratively to a person particularly a head of state or government who abuses their power and authority to oppress their people subjects or subordinates in this sense it is similar to the pejorative connotations that have likewise arisen with the term tyrant dictator has also developed nearly similar pejorative connotations of all the ancient greeks aristotle was perhaps the most influential promoter of the concept of oriental despotism his student alexander the great who conquered persia ruled by the despotic darius iii last king of the achaemenid dynasty aristotle asserted that oriental despotism is based not on force but on consent hence fear cannot be said to be its motive
an illiberal democracy also called a partial democracy low intensity democracy empty democracy or hybrid regime is a governing system in which although elections take place citizens are cut off from knowledge about the activities of those who exercise real power because of the lack of civil liberties it is not an open society there are many countries that are categorized as neither free nor not free but as probably free falling somewhere between democratic and nondemocratic regimes this may be because a constitution limiting government powers exists but its liberties are ignored or because an adequate legal constitutional framework of liberties does not exist the term illiberal democracy was used by fareed zakaria in a regularly cited article in the journal foreign affairs writers such as steven levitsky and lucan way reject the concept of an illiberal democracy saying it only muddies the waters on the basis that it if a country does not have opposition parties and an independent media it is not democratic they argue that terms like illiberal democracy are inappropriate for some of these states because the term implies that these regimes are at their heart democracies that have gone wrong levitsky and way argue that states such as serbia under slobodan milosevic zimbabwe and post soviet russia were never truly democratic and not developing toward democracy but were rather tending toward authoritarian behavior despite having elections which were sometimes sharply contested thus levitsky and way coined a new term to remove the positive connotation of democracy from these states and distinguish them from flawed or developing democracies competitive authoritarianism according to zakaria illiberal democracies are increasing around the world and are increasingly limiting the freedoms of the people they represent zakaria points out that in the west electoral democracy and civil liberties of speech

am i the only one who thinks that the template should be reduced in size there are some really esoteric concepts that do not really exist in modern practical politics i am not suggesting that the idea of kritarchy is useless but it is not in existence as a form of government compared to a monarchy dictatorship republic etc let s keep in mind that a government s form is different from its qualities many of the items on the template refer to qualities inherent in basic forms of government it seems the dividing line is this there is a difference between forms of government in practice and qualities of government in theory philosophy as an overview of basic and practical concepts i believe that the template should provide navigation to functional systems of government and the theoretical concepts should be removed if we can t gain a concensus to reduce the template based on the broader concepts of government then i suggest that we make a seperate navigational template for theoretical philosophical forms of government for example minarchism really is a philosophical concept that does not describe a functioning structural form of government none of this is meant to disparage anyone s favorite governmental philosophy we can all agree that nav templates cannot always contain every single topic they must touch on the biggies additionally i think the concept of this template has been lost by veering into the theoretical that robocracy is listed is a case in point anyway the template has a direct link to a list of forms of government i propose the following for the template as concrete functional systems of government concepts that describe a power structure and the application of that structure to citizens complete list of forms of government before i go
