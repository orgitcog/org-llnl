science nb is a systematic enterprise that creates builds and organizes knowledge in the form of testable explanations and predictions about the universe nb contemporary science is typically subdivided into the natural sciences which study the material world the social sciences which study people and societies and the formal sciences like mathematics the formal sciences are often excluded as they do not depend on empirical observations disciplines which use science like engineering and medicine may also be considered to be applied sciences from classical antiquity through the th century science as a type of knowledge was more closely linked to philosophy than it is now and in fact in the west the term natural philosophy encompassed fields of study that are today associated with science such as physics astronomy medicine among many others nb in the th and th centuries scientists increasingly sought to formulate knowledge in terms of laws of nature over the course of the th century the word science became increasingly associated with the scientific method itself as a disciplined way to study the natural world it was in the th century that modern scientific disciplines such as physics chemistry and biology reached their modern shapes the same time period also included the origin of the terms scientist and scientific community the founding of scientific institutions and increasing significance of the interactions with society and other aspects of culture science in a broad sense existed before the modern era and in many historical civilizations nb modern science is distinct in its approach and successful in its results modern science now defines what science is in the strictest sense of the term science in its original sense is a word for a type of knowledge rather than a specialized word for the pursuit of such knowledge in particular
diagnosis is the identification of the nature and cause of a certain phenomenon diagnosis is used in many different disciplines with variations in the use of logics analytics and experience to determine cause and effect in systems engineering and computer science it is typically used to determine the causes of symptoms mitigations and solutions
therapy often abbreviated tx or tx is the attempted remediation of a health problem usually following a diagnosis in the medical field it is usually synonymous with treatment also abbreviated tx among psychologists and other mental health professionals including psychiatrists psychiatric nurse practitioners and clinical social workers the term may refer specifically to psychotherapy sometimes dubbed talking therapy the english word therapy comes via latin therap a from greek and literally means curing or healing as a rule each therapy has indications and contraindications the words care therapy treatment and intervention overlap in a semantic field and thus they can be synonymous depending on context moving rightward through that order the connotative level of holism decreases and the level of specificity to concrete instances increases thus in health care contexts where its senses are always noncount the word care tends to imply a broad idea of everything done to protect or improve someone s health for example as in the terms preventive care and primary care which connote ongoing action although it sometimes implies a narrower idea for example in the simplest cases of wound care or postanesthesia care a few particular steps are sufficient and the patient s interaction with that provider is soon finished in contrast the word intervention tends to be specific and concrete and thus the word is often countable for example one instance of cardiac catheterization is one intervention performed and coronary care noncount can require a series of interventions count at the extreme the piling on of such countable interventions amounts to interventionism a flawed model of care lacking holistic circumspection merely treating discrete problems in billable increments rather than maintaining health therapy and treatment in the middle of the semantic field can connote either the holism of care or the discreteness of intervention

biomedical sciences are a set of applied sciences applying portions of natural science or formal science or both to develop knowledge interventions or technology of use in healthcare or public health such disciplines as medical microbiology clinical virology clinical epidemiology genetic epidemiology and biomedical engineering are medical sciences explaining physiological mechanisms operating in pathological processes however pathophysiology can be regarded as basic science there are at least different specialisms within healthcare science which are traditionally grouped into three main divisions the healthcare science workforce is an important part of the uk s national health service while people working in healthcare science are only of the staff of the nhs percent of all diagnosis can be attributed to their work the volume of specialist healthcare science work is a significant part of the work of the nhs every year nhs healthcare scientists carry out the four governments of the uk have recognised the importance of healthcare science to the nhs introducing the modernising scientific careers initiative to ensure that the education and training for healthcare scientists ensures there is the flexibility to meet patient needs while keeping up to date with scientific developments
biomedical research or experimental medicine is in general simply known as medical research it is the basic research applied research or translational research conducted to aid and support the development body of knowledge in the field of medicine an important kind of medical research is clinical research which is distinguished by the involvement of patients other kinds of medical research include pre clinical research for example on animals and basic medical research for example in genetics both clinical and pre clinical research phases exist in the pharmaceutical industry s drug pipelines where the clinical phase is denoted by the term clinical trial however only part of the whole of clinical or pre clinical research is oriented towards a specific pharmaceutical purpose the need for understanding diagnostics medical devices and non pharmaceutical therapies means that medical research is much bigger than just trying to make new drugs the most basic medical research is a rapidly evolving area that owes much to basic biology and is given names such as human biosciences by universities a new paradigm to biomedical research is being termed translational research which focuses on iterative feedback loops between the basic and clinical research domains to accelerate knowledge translation from the bedside to the bench and back again medical research may involve doing research into public health biochemistry clinical research microbiology physiology oncology surgery and research into many other non communicable diseases such as diabetes and cardiovascular diseases the increased longevity of humans over the past century can be significantly attributed to advances resulting from medical research among the major benefits of medical research have been vaccines for measles and polio insulin treatment for diabetes classes of antibiotics for treating a host of maladies medication for high blood pressure improved treatments for aids statins and other treatments for atherosclerosis
medical genetics is the specialty of medicine that involves the diagnosis and management of hereditary disorders medical genetics differs from human genetics in that human genetics is a field of scientific research that may or may not apply to medicine but medical genetics refers to the application of genetics to medical care for eg research on the causes and inheritance of genetic disorders would be considered within both human genetics and medical genetics while the diagnosis management and counseling of individuals with genetic disorders would be considered part of medical genetics in contrast the study of typically non medical phenotypes such as the genetics of eye color would be considered part of human genetics but not necessarily relevant to medical genetics except in situations such as albinism genetic medicine is a newer term for medical genetics and incorporates areas such as gene therapy personalized medicine and the rapidly emerging new medical specialty predictive medicine medical genetics encompasses many different areas including clinical practice of physicians genetic counselors and nutritionists clinical diagnostic laboratory activities and research into the causes and inheritance of genetic disorders examples of conditions that fall within the scope of medical genetics include birth defects and dysmorphology mental retardation autism and mitochondrial disorders skeletal dysplasia connective tissue disorders cancer genetics teratogens and prenatal diagnosis medical genetics is increasingly becoming relevant to many common diseases overlaps with other medical specialties are beginning to emerge as recent advances in genetics are revealing etiologies for neurologic endocrine cardiovascular pulmonary ophthalmologic renal psychiatric and dermatologic conditions in some ways many of the individual fields within medical genetics are hybrids between clinical care and research this is due in part to recent advances in science and technology for example see the human genome project that have enabled an unprecedented understanding of genetic disorders
health technology is application of organized knowledge and skills in the form of devices medicines vaccines procedures and systems developed to solve a health problem and improve quality of lives this includes the pharmaceuticals devices procedures and organizational systems used in health care medical technology which is a proper subset of health technology encompasses a wide range of healthcare products and is used to diagnose monitor or treat diseases or medical conditions affecting humans such technologies applications of medical science are intended to improve the quality of healthcare delivered through earlier diagnosis less invasive treatment options and reductions in hospital stays and rehabilitation times recent advances in medical technology have also focused on cost reduction medical technology may broadly include medical devices information technology biotech and healthcare services the impacts of medical technology may involve social and ethical issues for example physicians may seek objective information from technology rather than listening to subjective patient reports a major driver of the sector s growth is the consumerization of medtech supported by the widespread availability of smartphones and tablets providers are able to reach a large audience at low cost a trend that stands to be consolidated as wearable technologies spread throughout the market the term medical technology may also refer to the duties performed by clinical laboratory professionals in various settings within the public and private sectors the work of these professionals encompass clinical applications of chemistry genetics hematology immunohematology blood banking immunology microbiology serology urinalysis and miscellaneous body fluid analysis depending on location educational level and certifying body these professionals may be referred to as biomedical scientists medical laboratory scientists mls medical technologists mt medical laboratory technologists and medical laboratory technicians
medical diagnosis abbreviated ds or dx is the process of determining which disease or condition explains a person s symptoms and signs it is most often referred to as diagnosis with the medical context being implicit the information required for diagnosis is typically collected from a history and physical examination of the person seeking medical care often one or more diagnostic procedures such as diagnostic tests are also done during the process sometimes posthumous diagnosis is considered a kind of medical diagnosis diagnosis is often challenging because many signs and symptoms are nonspecific for example redness of the skin erythema by itself is a sign of many disorders and thus doesn t tell the healthcare professional what is wrong thus differential diagnosis in which several possible explanations are compared and contrasted must be performed this involves the correlation of various pieces of information followed by the recognition and differentiation of patterns occasionally the process is made easy by a sign or symptom or a group of several that is pathognomonic diagnosis is a major component of the procedure of a doctor s visit from the point of view of statistics the diagnostic procedure involves classification tests the first recorded examples of medical diagnosis are found in the writings of imhotep bc in ancient egypt the edwin smith papyrus a babylonian medical textbook the diagnostic handbook written by esagil kin apli fl bc introduced the use of empiricism logic and rationality in the diagnosis of an illness or disease traditional chinese medicine as described in the yellow emperor s inner canon or huangdi neijing specified four diagnostic methods inspection auscultation olfaction interrogation and palpation hippocrates was known to make diagnoses by tasting his patients urine and smelling their sweat the plural of diagnosis is diagnoses the verb is to diagnose and

a splint is a device used for support or immobilization of a limb or the spine it can be used in multiple situations including temporary immobilization of potentially broken bones or damaged joints and support for joints during activity commonly used after surgery to provide support to an incised area and decrease pain on coughing while the patient attempts to cough the area is braced by the patient or assistant using pillow folded blanket or extended hand placed over the incision gentle pressure is applied for bracing only during the attempt to cough different forms of the splint have been used sparingly throughout history however the splint gained great popularity as a medical device during the french and indian war citation needed generally consisting of two small wooden planks the splint was commonly tied around the fracture with rope cloth or even rawhide during frontier times in american history to this day the splint is commonly used to secure small fractures and breaks see for example henry gassett davis
a medical device is an instrument apparatus implant in vitro reagent or similar or related article that is used to diagnose prevent or treat disease or other conditions and does not achieve its purposes through chemical action within or on the body which would make it a drug whereas medicinal products also called pharmaceuticals achieve their principal action by pharmacological metabolic or immunological means medical devices act by other means like physical mechanical or thermal means medical devices vary greatly in complexity and application examples range from simple devices such as tongue depressors medical thermometers and disposable gloves to advanced devices such as computers which assist in the conduct of medical testing implants and prostheses the design of medical devices constitutes a major segment of the field of biomedical engineering the global medical device market reached roughly billion in biomedical device product manufacturing is a long process requiring robust sops and guidelines for production these days with the aid of cad or modelling platforms the work is now much faster and this can act also as a tool for strategic design generation as well as a marketing tool failure to meet cost targets will lead to substantial losses for an organisation in addition with global competition the r d of new biomedical devices is not just a necessity it is an imperative for biomedical device manufacturing companies the realisation of a new design can be very costly especially with the shorter product life cycle as technology advances there is typically a level of quality safety and reliability that increases exponentially with time for example initial models of the artificial cardiac pacemaker were external support devices that transmits pulses of electricity to the heart muscles via electrode leads on the chest the electrodes contact the heart directly through the chest allowing
a biopharmaceutical also known as a biologic al medical product biological or biologic is any medicinal product manufactured in extracted from or semisynthesized from biological sources different from chemically synthesized pharmaceuticals they include vaccines blood or blood components allergenics somatic cells gene therapies tissues recombinant therapeutic protein and living cells used in cell therapy biologics can be composed of sugars proteins or nucleic acids or complex combinations of these substances or may be living cells or tissues they are isolated from natural sources human animal or microorganism terminology surrounding biopharmaceuticals varies between groups and entities with different terms referring to different subsets of therapeutics within the general biopharmaceutical category some regulatory agencies use the terms biological medicinal products or therapeutic biological product to refer specifically to engineered macromolecular products like protein and nucleic acid based drugs distinguishing them from products like blood blood components or vaccines which are usually extracted directly from a biological source specialty drugs a recent classification of pharmaceuticals are high cost drugs that are often biologics gene based and cellular biologics for example often are at the forefront of biomedical research and may be used to treat a variety of medical conditions for which no other treatments are available in some jurisdictions biologics are regulated via different pathways than other small molecule drugs and medical devices the term biopharmacology is sometimes used to describe the branch of pharmacology that studies biopharmaceuticals some of the oldest forms of biologics are extracted from the bodies of animals and other humans especially important biologics include some biologics that were previously extracted from animals such as insulin are now more commonly produced by recombinant dna as indicated the term biologics can be used to refer to a wide range of biological products in medicine however in most cases the term
radiation therapy or radiotherapy often abbreviated rt rtx or xrt is therapy using ionizing radiation generally as part of cancer treatment to control or kill malignant cells radiation therapy may be curative in a number of types of cancer if they are localized to one area of the body it may also be used as part of adjuvant therapy to prevent tumor recurrence after surgery to remove a primary malignant tumor for example early stages of breast cancer radiation therapy is synergistic with chemotherapy and has been used before during and after chemotherapy in susceptible cancers the subspecialty of oncology that focuses on radiotherapy is called radiation oncology radiation therapy is commonly applied to the cancerous tumor because of its ability to control cell growth ionizing radiation works by damaging the dna of cancerous tissue leading to cellular death to spare normal tissues such as skin or organs which radiation must pass through to treat the tumor shaped radiation beams are aimed from several angles of exposure to intersect at the tumor providing a much larger absorbed dose there than in the surrounding healthy tissue besides the tumour itself the radiation fields may also include the draining lymph nodes if they are clinically or radiologically involved with tumor or if there is thought to be a risk of subclinical malignant spread it is necessary to include a margin of normal tissue around the tumor to allow for uncertainties in daily set up and internal tumor motion these uncertainties can be caused by internal movement for example respiration and bladder filling and movement of external skin marks relative to the tumor position radiation oncology is the medical specialty concerned with prescribing radiation and is distinct from radiology the use of radiation in medical imaging and diagnosis radiation may be prescribed by

a medicine man or medicine woman is a traditional healer and spiritual leader among the native americans in the united states and the first nations in canada the terms are also used to refer to traditional healers of other indigenous peoples the primary function of these medicine elders is to secure the help of the spirit world including the great spirit wakan tanka in the language of the lakota people for the benefit of the entire community sometimes the help sought may be for the sake of healing disease sometimes it may be for the sake of healing the psyche sometimes the goal is to promote harmony between human groups or between humans nature so the term medicine man woman is not entirely inappropriate but it greatly oversimplifies and also skews the depiction of the people whose role in society complements that of the chief these people are not the native american equivalent of the chinese barefoot doctors herbalists nor of the emergency medical technicians who ride rescue vehicles to be recognized as the one who performs this function of bridging between the natural world and the spiritual world for the benefit of the community an individual must be validated in his role by that community medicine men and women study through a medicine society or from a single teacher the term medicine people is commonly used in native american communities for example when arwen nuttall cherokee of the national museum of the american indian writes the knowledge possessed by medicine people is privileged and it often remains in particular families native americans tend to be quite reluctant to discuss issues about medicine or medicine people with non indians in some cultures the people will not even discuss these matters with indians from other tribes in most tribes medicine elders
prayer from the latin precari to ask earnestly beg entreat is an invocation or act that seeks to activate a rapport with an object of worship through deliberate communication prayer can be a form of religious practice may be either individual or communal and take place in public or in private it may involve the use of words song or complete silence when language is used prayer may take the form of a hymn incantation formal creedal statement or a spontaneous utterance in the praying person there are different forms of prayer such as petitionary prayer prayers of supplication thanksgiving and praise prayer may be directed towards a deity spirit deceased person or lofty idea for the purpose of worshipping requesting guidance requesting assistance confessing transgressions sins or to express one s thoughts and emotions thus people pray for many reasons such as personal benefit asking for divine grace spiritual connection or for the sake of others some anthropologists believe that the earliest intelligent modern humans practiced a form of prayer today most major religions involve prayer in one way or another some ritualize the act of prayer requiring a strict sequence of actions or placing a restriction on who is permitted to pray while others teach that prayer may be practiced spontaneously by anyone at any time scientific studies regarding the use of prayer have mostly concentrated on its effect on the healing of sick or injured people meta studies of the studies in this field have been performed showing evidence only for no effect or a potentially small effect for instance a meta analysis on studies concluded that there is no discernable effect while a systemic review of studies on intercessory prayer reported inconclusive results noting that of studies had small but significant effect sizes but the review
a physician or doctor is a professional who practices medicine which is concerned with promoting maintaining or restoring human health through the study diagnosis and treatment of disease injury and other physical and mental impairments physicians may focus their practice on certain disease categories types of patients or methods of treatment known as specialist medical practitioners or assume responsibility for the provision of continuing and comprehensive medical care to individuals families and communities known as general practitioners medical practice properly requires both a detailed knowledge of the academic disciplines such as anatomy and physiology underlying diseases and their treatment the science of medicine and also a decent competence in its applied practice the art or craft of medicine both the role of the physician and the meaning of the word itself vary around the world degrees and other qualifications vary widely but there are some common elements such as medical ethics requiring that physicians show consideration compassion and benevolence for their patients around the world the term physician refers to a specialist in internal medicine or one of its many sub specialties especially as opposed to a specialist in surgery this meaning of physician conveys a sense of expertise in treatment by drugs or medications rather than by the procedures of surgeons this term is at least nine hundred years old in english physicians and surgeons were once members of separate professions and traditionally were rivals the shorter oxford english dictionary third edition gives a middle english quotation making this contrast from as early as o lord whi is it so greet difference betwixe a cirugian and a physician henry viii granted a charter to the london royal college of physicians in it was not until that he granted the company of barber surgeons ancestor of the royal college of
bloodletting or blood letting is the withdrawal of blood from a patient to cure or prevent illness and disease bloodletting was based on an ancient system of medicine in which blood and other bodily fluids were regarded as humors that had to remain in proper balance to maintain health it is claimed to have been the most common medical practice performed by surgeons from antiquity until the late th century a span of almost years in europe the practice continued to be relatively common until the end of the th century the practice has now been abandoned by modern style medicine for all except a few very specific conditions it is conceivable that historically in the absence of other treatments for hypertension bloodletting could sometimes have had a beneficial effect in temporarily reducing blood pressure by reducing blood volume however since hypertension is very often asymptomatic and thus undiagnosable without modern methods this effect was unintentional in the overwhelming majority of cases the historical use of bloodletting was harmful to patients today the term phlebotomy refers to the drawing of blood for laboratory analysis or blood transfusion therapeutic phlebotomy refers to the drawing of a unit of blood in specific cases like hemochromatosis polycythemia vera porphyria cutanea tarda etc to reduce the number of red blood cells the traditional medical practice of bloodletting is today considered to be a pseudoscience bloodletting was first performed in ancient egypt around bce and later spread to the greeks and romans in greece bloodletting was in use in the fifth century b c during the lifetime of hippocrates who mentions this practice but generally relied on dietary techniques erasistratus however theorized that many diseases were caused by plethoras or overabundances in the blood and advised that these plethoras be treated initially by exercise sweating
humorism or humoralism was a system of medicine detailing the makeup and workings of the human body adopted by the indian ayurveda system of medicine ancient greek and roman physicians and philosophers positing that an excess or deficiency of any of four distinct bodily fluids in a person known as humors or humours directly influences their temperament and health the humoralist system of medicine is highly individualistic for each individual patient was said to have their own unique humoral composition moreover it resembled a holistic approach to medicine as the link between mental and physical processes were emphasized by this framework from hippocrates onward the humoral theory was adopted by greek roman and persian physicians and became the most commonly held view of the human body among european physicians until the advent of modern medical research in the nineteenth century the concept has not been used in medicine since then the four humors of hippocratic medicine are black bile greek melaina chole yellow bile greek chole phlegm greek phlegma and blood greek haima and each corresponds to one of the traditional four temperaments a humor is also referred to as a cambium pl cambia or cambiums essentially this theory holds that the human body is filled with four basic substances called humors which are in balance when a person is healthy all diseases and disabilities supposedly resulted from an excess or deficit of one of these four humors these deficits were thought to be caused by vapors inhaled or absorbed by the body the four humors are black bile yellow bile phlegm and blood these terms only partly correspond to the modern medical terminology in which there is no distinction between black and yellow bile and in which phlegm has a very different meaning these humors may have their roots
the history of science is the study of the development of science and scientific knowledge including both the natural sciences and social sciences the history of the arts and humanities is termed as the history of scholarship science is a body of empirical theoretical and practical knowledge about the natural world produced by scientists who emphasize the observation explanation and prediction of real world phenomena historiography of science in contrast often draws on the historical methods of both intellectual history and social history the english word scientist is relatively recent first coined by william whewell in the th century previously people investigating nature called themselves natural philosophers while empirical investigations of the natural world have been described since classical antiquity for example by thales aristotle and others and scientific methods have been employed since the middle ages for example by ibn al haytham and roger bacon the dawn of modern science is often traced back to the early modern period and in particular to the scientific revolution that took place in th and th century europe scientific methods are considered to be so fundamental to modern science that some consider earlier inquiries into nature to be pre scientific traditionally historians of science have defined science sufficiently broadly to include those inquiries from the th century through late th century the history of science especially of the physical and biological sciences was often presented in a progressive narrative in which true theories replaced false beliefs more recent historical interpretations such as those of thomas kuhn tend to portray the history of science in different terms such as that of competing paradigms or conceptual systems in a wider matrix that includes intellectual cultural economic and political themes outside of science in prehistoric times advice and knowledge was passed from generation to generation
basic research also called pure research or fundamental research is scientific research aimed to improve scientific theories for improved understanding or prediction of natural or other phenomena applied research in turn uses scientific theories to develop technology or techniques to intervene and alter natural or other phenomena though often driven by curiosity basic research fuels applied science s innovations the two aims are often coordinated in research and development although many discoveries have been serendipitous discovery science specifically seeks discoveries and along with theoretical science and experimental science is now key to basic research and is sometimes expressly planned basic research advances fundamental knowledge about the world it focuses on refuting or supporting theories that explain observed phenomena pure research is the source of most new scientific ideas and ways of thinking about the world it can be exploratory descriptive or explanatory however explanatory research is the most common basic research generates new ideas principles and theories which may not be immediately utilized but nonetheless form the basis of progress and development in different fields today s computers for example could not exist without research in pure mathematics conducted over a century ago for which there was no known practical application at the time basic research rarely helps practitioners directly with their everyday concerns nevertheless it stimulates new ways of thinking that have the potential to revolutionize and dramatically improve how practitioners deal with a problem in the future applied science focuses on the development of technology and techniques in contrast basic science develops scientific knowledge and predictions principally in natural sciences but also in other empirical sciences which are used as the scientific foundation for applied science basic science develops and establishes information to predict phenomena and perhaps to understand nature whereas applied science uses portions of basic science
applied science is a discipline of science that applies existing scientific knowledge to develop more practical applications like technology or inventions within natural science disciplines that are basic science also called pure science develop information to predict and perhaps explain thus somehow understand phenomena in the natural world applied science applies science to real world practice this includes a broad range of science fields from engineering to child care applied science can also apply formal science such as statistics and probability theory as in epidemiology genetic epidemiology is an applied science applying both biological and statistical methods engineering sciences include thermodynamics heat transfer fluid mechanics statics dynamics mechanics of materials kinematics electromagnetism materials science earth sciences engineering physics medical sciences for instance medical microbiology and its clinical virology are applied sciences that apply biology toward medical knowledge and inventions but not necessarily medical technology whose development is more specifically biomedicine or biomedical engineering in the united kingdom s educational system applied science refers to a suite of vocational science qualifications that run alongside traditional general certificate of secondary education or a level sciences applied science courses generally contain more coursework also known as portfolio or internally assessed work compared to their traditional counterparts these are an evolution of the gnvq qualifications that were offered up to these courses regularly come under scrutiny and are due for review following the wolf report however their merits are argued elsewhere in the united states the college of william mary offers an undergraduate minor as well as master of science and doctor of philosophy degrees in applied science courses and research cover varied fields including neuroscience optics materials science and engineering nondestructive testing and nuclear magnetic resonance in new york city the bloomberg administration awarded the consortium of cornell technion million in city capital
an umbrella term is a word or phrase that covers a broad interval or set of functions or items that all fall under a single common category for example cryptology is an umbrella term that encompasses cryptography and cryptanalysis among other fields similarly an umbrella organization is a central and coordinating body representing a number of smaller separate bodies the closely related blanket term is a word or phrase that is used to describe multiple groups of related things the degree of relation may vary even have a minimal relationship but blanket terms often trade specificity for ease of use in other words a blanket term by itself gives little detail about the things that it describes or the relationships between them but is easy to say and remember blanket terms may originate as slang and eventually become integrated into the general vocabulary
surgical suture commonly called stitches is a medical device used to hold body tissues together after an injury or surgery application generally involves using a needle with an attached length of thread a number of different shapes sizes and thread materials have been developed over its millennia of history surgeons physicians dentists podiatrists eye doctors registered nurses and other trained nursing personnel medics and clinical pharmacists typically engage in suturing surgical knots are used to secure the sutures through many millennia various suture materials were used debated and remained largely unchanged needles were made of bone or metals such as silver copper and aluminium bronze wire sutures were made of plant materials flax hemp and cotton or animal material hair tendons arteries muscle strips and nerves silk and catgut the earliest reports of surgical suture date back to bc in ancient egypt and the oldest known suture is in a mummy from bc a detailed description of a wound suture and the suture materials used in it is by the indian sage and physician sushruta written in bc citation needed the greek father of medicine hippocrates described suture techniques as did the later roman aulus cornelius celsus the nd century roman physician galen described gut sutures in the th century the manufacturing process involved harvesting sheep intestines the so called catgut suture and was similar to that of strings for violins guitar and tennis racquets joseph lister endorsed the routine sterilization of all suture threads he first attempted sterilization with the s carbolic catgut and chromic catgut followed two decades later sterile catgut was finally achieved in with iodine treatment the next great leap came in the twentieth century the chemical industry drove production of the first synthetic thread in the early s which exploded into production of numerous absorbable
cytology from greek kytos a hollow and logia is the study of cells cytology is that branch of life science that deals with the study of cells in terms of structure function and chemistry robert hooke is sometimes seen as the father of cytology based on usage it can refer to the international academy of cytology has as its official journal acta cytologica
molecular medicine is a broad field where physical chemical biological and medical techniques are used to describe molecular structures and mechanisms identify fundamental molecular and genetic errors of disease and to develop molecular interventions to correct them the molecular medicine perspective emphasizes cellular and molecular phenomena and interventions rather than the previous conceptual and observational focus on patients and their organs in november with the seminal paper sickle cell anemia a molecular disease in science magazine linus pauling harvey itano and their collaborators laid the groundwork for establishing the field of molecular medicine in roger j williams wrote biochemical individuality a prescient book about genetics prevention and treatment of disease on a molecular basis and nutrition which is now variously referred to as individualized medicine and orthomolecular medicine another paper in science by pauling in introduced and defined this view of molecular medicine that focuses on natural and nutritional substances used for treatment and prevention published research and progress was slow until the s biological revolution that introduced many new techniques and commercial applications molecular medicine is a new scientific discipline in european universities combining contemporary medical studies with the field of biochemistry it offers a bridge between the two subjects at present only a handful of universities offer the course to undergraduates with a degree in this discipline the graduate is able to pursue a career in medical sciences scientific research laboratory work and postgraduate medical degrees core subjects are similar to biochemistry courses and typically include gene expression research methods proteins cancer research immunology biotechnology and many more besides in some universities molecular medicine is combined with another discipline such as chemistry functioning as an additional study to enrich the undergraduate program

acupuncture from latin acus needle and punctura to puncture is a form of alternative medicine and a key component of traditional chinese medicine tcm involving thin needles inserted into the body at acupuncture points it can be associated with the application of heat pressure or laser light to these same points acupuncture is commonly used for pain relief though it is also used for a wide range of other conditions clinical practice varies depending on the country there is a diverse range of acupuncture approaches involving different philosophies the method used in tcm is likely the most widely adopted in the us it is rarely used alone but rather as an adjunct to other forms of treatment tcm theory and practice are not based upon scientific knowledge and acupuncture has been described as a type of pseudoscience the conclusions of many trials and numerous systematic reviews of acupuncture are largely inconsistent an overview of cochrane reviews found that acupuncture is not effective for a wide range of conditions and they suggest it may be effective for only chemotherapy induced nausea vomiting postoperative nausea vomiting and idiopathic headache an overview of high quality cochrane reviews suggests that acupuncture may alleviate certain kinds of pain a systematic review of systematic reviews found little evidence of acupuncture s effectiveness in treating pain the evidence suggests that short term treatment with acupuncture does not produce long term benefits some research results suggest acupuncture can alleviate pain though the majority of research suggests that acupuncture s effects are mainly due to placebo a systematic review concluded that the analgesic effect of acupuncture seemed to lack clinical relevance and could not be clearly distinguished from bias acupuncture is generally safe when done by an appropriately trained practitioner using clean needle technique and single use needles when
quackery is the promotion of fraudulent or ignorant medical practices a quack is a fraudulent or ignorant pretender to medical skill or a person who pretends professionally or publicly to have skill knowledge or qualifications he or she does not possess a charlatan the term quack is a clipped form of the archaic term quacksalver from dutch quacksalver a hawker of salve in the middle ages the term quack meant shouting the quacksalvers sold their wares on the market shouting in a loud voice common elements of general quackery include questionable diagnoses using questionable diagnostic tests as well as alternative or refuted treatments especially for serious diseases such as cancer health fraud is often used as a synonym for quackery not verified in body but quackery s salient characteristic is its more aggressive promotion quacks quack pseudo medicine is a term for treatments known to be ineffective regardless of whether their advocates themselves believe in their effectiveness in determining whether a person is committing quackery the central question is what is acceptable evidence for the efficacy and safety of whatever treatments cures regimens or procedures the alleged quack advocates citation needed since it is difficult to distinguish between those who knowingly promote unproven medical therapies and those who are mistaken as to their effectiveness u s courts have ruled in defamation cases that accusing someone of quackery or calling a practitioner a quack is not equivalent to accusing that person of committing medical fraud to be both quackery and fraud the quack must know they are misrepresenting the benefits and risks of the medical services offered instead of for example promoting an ineffective product they honestly believe is effective citation needed in addition to the ethical problems of promising benefits that can not reasonably be expected to occur quackery also

evidence based medicine ebm is an approach to medical practice intended to optimize decision making by emphasizing the use of evidence from well designed and conducted research although all medicine based on science has some degree of empirical support ebm goes further classifying evidence by its epistemologic strength and requiring that only the strongest types coming from meta analyses systematic reviews and randomized controlled trials can yield strong recommendations weaker types such as from case control studies can yield only weak recommendations the term was originally used to describe an approach to teaching the practice of medicine and improving decisions by individual physicians about individual patients use of the term rapidly expanded to include a previously described approach that emphasized the use of evidence in the design of guidelines and policies that apply to groups of patients and populations evidence based practice policies it has subsequently spread to describe an approach to decision making that is used at virtually every level of health care as well as other fields evidence based practice whether applied to medical education decisions about individuals guidelines and policies applied to populations or administration of health services in general evidence based medicine advocates that to the greatest extent possible decisions and policies should be based on evidence not just the beliefs of practitioners experts or administrators it thus tries to assure that a clinician s opinion which may be limited by knowledge gaps or biases is supplemented with all available knowledge from the scientific literature so that best practice can be determined and applied it promotes the use of formal explicit methods to analyze evidence and make it available to decision makers it promotes programs to teach the methods to medical students practitioners and policy makers in its broadest form evidence based medicine is the application
medical diagnosis abbreviated ds or dx is the process of determining which disease or condition explains a person s symptoms and signs it is most often referred to as diagnosis with the medical context being implicit the information required for diagnosis is typically collected from a history and physical examination of the person seeking medical care often one or more diagnostic procedures such as diagnostic tests are also done during the process sometimes posthumous diagnosis is considered a kind of medical diagnosis diagnosis is often challenging because many signs and symptoms are nonspecific for example redness of the skin erythema by itself is a sign of many disorders and thus doesn t tell the healthcare professional what is wrong thus differential diagnosis in which several possible explanations are compared and contrasted must be performed this involves the correlation of various pieces of information followed by the recognition and differentiation of patterns occasionally the process is made easy by a sign or symptom or a group of several that is pathognomonic diagnosis is a major component of the procedure of a doctor s visit from the point of view of statistics the diagnostic procedure involves classification tests the first recorded examples of medical diagnosis are found in the writings of imhotep bc in ancient egypt the edwin smith papyrus a babylonian medical textbook the diagnostic handbook written by esagil kin apli fl bc introduced the use of empiricism logic and rationality in the diagnosis of an illness or disease traditional chinese medicine as described in the yellow emperor s inner canon or huangdi neijing specified four diagnostic methods inspection auscultation olfaction interrogation and palpation hippocrates was known to make diagnoses by tasting his patients urine and smelling their sweat the plural of diagnosis is diagnoses the verb is to diagnose and
the doctor patient relationship is central to the practice of healthcare and is essential for the delivery of high quality health care in the diagnosis and treatment of disease the doctor patient relationship forms one of the foundations of contemporary medical ethics most universities teach students from the beginning even before they set foot in hospitals to maintain a professional rapport with patients uphold patients dignity and respect their privacy a patient must have confidence in the competence of their physician and must feel that they can confide in him or her for most physicians the establishment of good rapport with a patient is important some medical specialties such as psychiatry and family medicine emphasize the physician patient relationship more than others such as pathology or radiology the quality of the patient physician relationship is important to both parties the better the relationship in terms of mutual respect knowledge trust shared values and perspectives about disease and life and time available the better will be the amount and quality of information about the patient s disease transferred in both directions enhancing accuracy of diagnosis and increasing the patient s knowledge about the disease where such a relationship is poor the physician s ability to make a full assessment is compromised and the patient is more likely to distrust the diagnosis and proposed treatment causing decreased compliance to actually follow the medical advice in these circumstances and also in cases where there is genuine divergence of medical opinions a second opinion from another physician may be sought or the patient may choose to go to another physician michael balint pioneered the study of the physician patient relationship in the uk with his wife enid balint resulting in the publication of the seminal book the doctor his patient and the illness balint
the medical history or medical case history also called anamnesis especially historically often abbreviated hx or hx of a patient is information gained by a physician by asking specific questions either of the patient or of other people who know the person and can give suitable information in this case it is sometimes called heteroanamnesis with the aim of obtaining information useful in formulating a diagnosis and providing medical care to the patient the medically relevant complaints reported by the patient or others familiar with the patient are referred to as symptoms in contrast with clinical signs which are ascertained by direct examination on the part of medical personnel most health encounters will result in some form of history being taken medical histories vary in their depth and focus for example an ambulance paramedic would typically limit their history to important details such as name history of presenting complaint allergies etc in contrast a psychiatric history is frequently lengthy and in depth as many details about the patient s life are relevant to formulating a management plan for a psychiatric illness the information obtained in this way together with the physical examination enables the physician and other health professionals to form a diagnosis and treatment plan if a diagnosis cannot be made a provisional diagnosis may be formulated and other possibilities the differential diagnoses may be added listed in order of likelihood by convention the treatment plan may then include further investigations to clarify the diagnosis a practitioner typically asks questions to obtain the following information about the patient history taking may be comprehensive history taking a fixed and extensive set of questions are asked as practiced only by health care students such as medical students physician assistant students or nurse practitioner students or iterative hypothesis testing questions are limited
the terms medical record health record and medical chart are used somewhat interchangeably to describe the systematic documentation of a single patient s medical history and care across time within one particular health care provider s jurisdiction the medical record includes a variety of types of notes entered over time by health care professionals recording observations and administration of drugs and therapies orders for the administration of drugs and therapies test results x rays reports etc the maintenance of complete and accurate medical records is a requirement of health care providers and is generally enforced as a licensing or certification prerequisite the terms are used for both the physical folder that exists for each individual patient and for the body of information found therein medical records have traditionally been compiled and maintained by health care providers but advances in online data storage have led to the development of personal health records phr that are maintained by patients themselves often on third party websites this concept is supported by us national health administration entities and by ahima the american health information management association because many consider the information in medical records to be sensitive personal information covered by expectations of privacy many ethical and legal issues are implicated in their maintenance such as third party access and appropriate storage and disposal although the storage equipment for medical records generally is the property of the health care provider the actual record is considered in most jurisdictions to be the property of the patient who may obtain copies upon request the information contained in the medical record allows health care providers to determine the patient s medical history and provide informed care the medical record serves as the central repository for planning patient care and documenting communication among patient and health care provider
a physical examination medical examination or clinical examination more popularly known as a check up is the process by which a medical professional investigates the body of a patient for signs of disease it generally follows the taking of the medical history an account of the symptoms as experienced by the patient together with the medical history the physical examination aids in determining the correct diagnosis and devising the treatment plan this data then becomes part of the medical record a cochrane collaboration meta study found that routine annual physicals did not measurably reduce the risk of illness or death and conversely could lead to over diagnosis and over treatment the authors concluded that routine physicals were unlikely to do more good than harm routine physicals are physical examinations performed on asymptomatic patients for medical screening purposes these are normally performed by a pediatrician family practice physician nurse practitioner or other primary care provider this routine physical exam usually includes the heent evaluation comprehensive physical exams also known as executive physicals typically include laboratory tests chest x rays pulmonary function testing audiograms full body cat scanning ekgs heart stress tests vascular age tests urinalysis and mammograms or prostate exams depending on gender pre employment examinations are screening tests which judge the suitability of a worker for hire based on the results of their physical examination this is also called pre employment medical clearance many employers believe that by only hiring workers whose physical examination results pass certain exclusionary criteria their employees collectively will have fewer absences due to sickness fewer workplace injuries and less occupational disease a small amount of low quality evidence in medical research supports the idea that pre employment physical examinations can actually reduce absences workplace injuries and occupational disease employers should not routinely request that workers
the stethoscope is an acoustic medical device for auscultation or listening to the internal sounds of an animal or human body it typically has a small disc shaped resonator that is placed against the chest and two tubes connected to earpieces it is often used to listen to lung and heart sounds it is also used to listen to intestines and blood flow in arteries and veins in combination with a sphygmomanometer it is commonly used for measurements of blood pressure less commonly mechanic s stethoscopes are used to listen to internal sounds made by machines such as diagnosing a malfunctioning automobile engine by listening to the sounds of its internal parts stethoscopes can also be used to check scientific vacuum chambers for leaks and for various other small scale acoustic monitoring tasks a stethoscope that intensifies auscultatory sounds is called phonendoscope the stethoscope was invented in france in by ren laennec at the necker enfants malades hospital in paris it consisted of a wooden tube and was monaural laennec invented the stethoscope because he was uncomfortable placing his ear on women s chests to hear heart sounds his device was similar to the common ear trumpet a historical form of hearing aid indeed his invention was almost indistinguishable in structure and function from the trumpet which was commonly called a microphone the first flexible stethoscope of any sort may have been a binaural instrument with articulated joints not very clearly described in in golding bird described a stethoscope he had been using with a flexible tube bird was the first to publish a description of such a stethoscope but he noted in his paper the prior existence of an earlier design which he thought was of little utility which he described as the snake ear trumpet bird s stethoscope
a tongue depressor is a tool used in medical practice to depress the tongue to allow for examination of the mouth and throat the most common modern tongue depressors are flat thin wooden blades smoothed and rounded at both ends but historically tongue depressors have been made of a variety of materials since they are inexpensive and difficult to clean wooden tongue depressors are labeled for disposal after a single use hobbyists and teachers have found a multitude of uses for tongue depressors sometimes called craft sticks or meyerhoffer sticks in their projects tongue depressors may be used to form so called stick bombs earlier versions of depressors were made from balsa pine or redwood woods for instance tongue depressors from the american civil war which were made from wood and metal exist
a medical sign is an objective indication of some medical fact or characteristic that may be detected by a physician during a physical examination of a patient for example whereas paresthesia is a symptom only the person experiencing it can directly observe their own tingling feeling erythema is a sign anyone can confirm that the skin is redder than usual symptoms and signs are often nonspecific but often combinations of them are at least suggestive of certain diagnoses helping to narrow down what may be wrong in other cases they are specific even to the point of being pathognomonic some signs may have no meaning to the patient and may even go unnoticed but may be meaningful and significant to the healthcare provider in assisting diagnosis examples of signs include elevated blood pressure a clubbing of the fingers which may be a sign of lung disease or many other things and arcus senilis the term sign is not to be confused with the term indication which denotes a valid reason for using some treatment the art of interpreting clinical signs was originally called semiotics a term now used for the study of sign communication in general in english this term then written semeiotics derived from the greek adjective semeiotikos to do with signs was first used in english in by henry stubbes to denote the branch of medical science relating to the interpretation of signs signs are different from symptoms the subjective experiences such as fatigue that patients might report to their examining physician for convenience signs are commonly distinguished from symptoms as follows both are something abnormal relevant to a potential medical condition but a symptom is experienced and reported by the patient while a sign is discovered by the physician during examination or by a clinical scientist by
a symptom from greek accident misfortune that which befalls from i befall from together with and i fall is a departure from normal function or feeling which is noticed by a patient reflecting the presence of an unusual state or of a disease a symptom is subjective observed by the patient and cannot be measured directly whereas a sign is objectively observable by others for example paresthesia is a symptom only the person experiencing it can directly observe their own tingling feeling whereas erythema is a sign anyone can confirm that the skin is redder than usual symptoms and signs are often nonspecific but often combinations of them are at least suggestive of certain diagnoses helping to narrow down what may be wrong in other cases they are specific even to the point of being pathognomonic the term is sometimes also applied to physiological states outside the context of disease as for example when referring to symptoms of pregnancy symptoms may be chronic relapsing or remitting asymptomatic conditions also exist e g subclinical infections and silent diseases like sometimes high blood pressure constitutional or general symptoms are those related to the systemic effects of a disease e g fever malaise anorexia and weight loss they affect the entire body rather than a specific organ or location the terms chief complaint presenting symptom iatrotropic symptom or presenting complaint are used to describe the initial concern which brings a patient to a doctor the symptom that ultimately leads to a diagnosis is called a cardinal symptom non specific symptoms are self reported symptoms that do not indicate a specific disease process or involve an isolated body system for example fatigue is a feature of many acute and chronic medical conditions which may or may not be mental and may be either a
a medical test is a kind of medical procedure performed to detect diagnose or monitor diseases disease processes susceptibility and determine a course of treatment there are risks and benefits with every medical test the risks include overdiagnosis missed disagnosis and risks from the test such as exposure to ionizing radiation from x rays or potential infection after a blood draw for common medical tests these risks are very small medical tests should not be performed unless the expected benefit exceeds the expected risks medical tests can be classified by what the test result will be used for mainly including usage for diagnosis screening or evaluation as separately detailed below a diagnostic test is a procedure performed to confirm or determine the presence of disease in an individual suspected of having the disease usually following the report of symptoms or based on the results of other medical tests this includes posthumous diagnosis such tests include screening refers to a medical test or series of tests used to detect or predict the presence of disease in individuals at risk for disease within a defined group such as a population family or workforce screenings may be performed to monitor disease prevalence manage epidemiology aid in prevention or strictly for statistical purposes examples of screenings include measuring the level of tsh in the blood of a newborn infant as part of newborn screening for congenital hypothyroidism checking for lung cancer in non smoking individuals who are exposed to second hand smoke in an unregulated working environment and pap smear screening for prevention or early detection of cervical cancer some medical tests are used to monitor the progress of or response to medical treatment most test methods can be classified into one of the following broad groups in vitro tests can be classified according
a blood test is a laboratory analysis performed on a blood sample that is usually extracted from a vein in the arm using a needle or via fingerprick multiple tests for specific blood components such as a glucose test or a cholesterol test are often grouped together into one test panel called a blood panel or blood work blood tests are often used in health care to determine physiological and biochemical states such as disease mineral content pharmaceutical drug effectiveness and organ function typical clinical blood panels include a basic metabolic panel or a complete blood count blood tests are also used in drug tests to detect drug abuse in some of the united states a blood test is required before marriage historically this was previously true in more states on october researchers at the vumc cancer center amsterdam reported developing a blood test that from a single drop of blood can diagnose cancer with a probability of and about probability of a false diagnosis in healthy patients venipuncture is useful as it is a minimally invasive way to obtain cells and extracellular fluid plasma from the body for analysis blood flows throughout the body acting as a medium which provides oxygen and nutrients to tissues and carries waste products back to the excretory systems for disposal coincidentally the state of the bloodstream affects or is affected by many medical conditions for these reasons blood tests are the most commonly performed medical tests if only a few drops of blood are needed a fingerstick is performed instead of drawing blood from a vein phlebotomists laboratory practitioners and nurses are those charged with patient blood extraction however in special circumstances and emergency situations paramedics and physicians sometimes extract blood also respiratory therapists are trained to extract arterial blood to examine arterial
a biopsy is a medical test commonly performed by a surgeon interventional radiologist or an interventional cardiologist involving sampling of cells or tissues for examination it is the medical removal of tissue from a living subject to determine the presence or extent of a disease the tissue is generally examined under a microscope by a pathologist and can also be analyzed chemically when an entire lump or suspicious area is removed the procedure is called an excisional biopsy when only a sample of tissue is removed with preservation of the histological architecture of the tissue s cells the procedure is called an incisional biopsy or core biopsy when a sample of tissue or fluid is removed with a needle in such a way that cells are removed without preserving the histological architecture of the tissue cells the procedure is called a needle aspiration biopsy biopsies are most commonly performed for insight into possible cancerous and inflammatory conditions biopsy is of greek origin coming from the words bios life and opsis a sight french dermatologist ernest besnier introduced the word biopsie to the medical community in one of the earliest diagnostic biopsies was developed by the arab physician abulcasis a needle was used to puncture a goiter and the material issuing was characterized verification needed when cancer is suspected a variety of biopsy techniques can be applied an excisional biopsy is an attempt to remove an entire lesion when the specimen is evaluated in addition to diagnosis the amount of uninvolved tissue around the lesion the surgical margin of the specimen is examined to see if the disease has spread beyond the area biopsied clear margins or negative margins means that no disease was found at the edges of the biopsy specimen positive margins means that disease was found and a
in medicine a differential diagnosis is the distinguishing of a particular disease or condition from others that present similar symptoms differential diagnostic procedures are used by physicians and other trained medical professionals to diagnose the specific disease in a patient or at least to eliminate any imminently life threatening conditions often each individual option of a possible disease is called a differential diagnosis for example bronchitis could be a differential diagnosis in the evaluation of a cough that ends up with a final diagnosis of common cold more generally a differential diagnostic procedure is a systematic diagnostic method used to identify the presence of an disease entity where multiple alternatives are possible this method is essentially a process of elimination or at least a process of obtaining information that shrinks the probabilities of candidate conditions to negligible levels by using evidence such as symptoms patient history and medical knowledge to adjust epistemic confidences in the mind of the diagnostician or for computerized or computer assisted diagnosis the software of the system differential diagnosis can be regarded as implementing aspects of the hypothetico deductive method in the sense that the potential presence of candidate diseases or conditions can be viewed as hypotheses that physicians further determine as being true or false common abbreviations of the term differential diagnosis include ddx ddx dd d dx or citation needed there are various methods of performing a differential diagnostic procedure but in general it is based on the idea that one begins by considering the most common diagnosis first a head cold versus meningitis for example as a reminder medical students are taught the occam s razor adage when you hear hoofbeats look for horses not zebras which means look for the simplest most common explanation first only after ruling out the simplest diagnosis

a pharmaceutical drug also referred to as a pharmaceutical pharmaceutical preparation pharmaceutical product medicinal product medicine medication medicament or simply a drug is a drug used to diagnose cure treat or prevent disease drug therapy pharmacotherapy is an important part of the medical field and relies on the science of pharmacology for continual advancement and on pharmacy for appropriate management drugs are classified in various ways one of the key divisions is by level of control which distinguishes prescription drugs those that a pharmacist dispenses only on the order of a physician physician assistant or qualified nurse from over the counter drugs those that consumers can order for themselves another key distinction is between traditional small molecule drugs usually derived from chemical synthesis and biopharmaceuticals which include recombinant proteins vaccines blood products used therapeutically such as ivig gene therapy and cell therapy for instance stem cell therapies other ways to classify medicines are by mode of action route of administration biological system affected or therapeutic effects an elaborate and widely used classification system is the anatomical therapeutic chemical classification system atc system the world health organization keeps a list of essential medicines drug discovery and drug development are complex and expensive endeavors undertaken by pharmaceutical companies academic scientists and governments governments generally regulate what drugs can be marketed how drugs are marketed and in some jurisdictions drug pricing controversies have arisen over drug pricing and disposal of used drugs in europe the term is medicinal product and it is defined by eu law as a any substance or combination of substances presented as having properties for treating or preventing disease in human beings or b any substance or combination of substances which may be used in or administered to human beings either with a view to restoring correcting or modifying
over the counter otc drugs are medicines sold directly to a consumer without a prescription from a healthcare professional as compared to prescription drugs which may be sold only to consumers possessing a valid prescription in many countries otc drugs are selected by a regulatory agency to ensure that they are ingredients that are safe and effective when used without a physician s care otc drugs are usually regulated by active pharmaceutical ingredients apis not final products by regulating apis instead of specific drug formulations governments allow manufacturers freedom to formulate ingredients or combinations of ingredients into proprietary mixtures the term over the counter may be somewhat counterintuitive since in many countries these drugs are often placed on shelves in self service areas of stores like any other packaged products in contrast prescription drugs are almost always passed over a counter from the pharmacist to the customer some drugs may be legally classified as over the counter i e no prescription is required but may only be dispensed by a pharmacist after an assessment of the patient s needs or the provision of patient education in many countries a number of otc drugs are available in establishments without a pharmacy such as general stores supermarkets and gas stations regulations detailing the establishments where drugs may be sold who is authorized to dispense them and whether a prescription is required vary considerably from country to country in canada there are four drug schedules all medications outside of schedule may be considered an otc drug as they do not require prescriptions for sale while the national association of pharmacy regulatory authorities provides recommendations on the scheduling of drugs for sale in canada each province may determine their own scheduling due to this the exact drugs found in each schedule may vary from
traditional medicine also known as indigenous or folk medicine comprises knowledge systems that developed over generations within various societies before the era of modern medicine the world health organization who defines traditional medicine as the sum total of the knowledge skills and practices based on the theories beliefs and experiences indigenous to different cultures whether explicable or not used in the maintenance of health as well as in the prevention diagnosis improvement or treatment of physical and mental illness in some asian and african countries up to of the population relies on traditional medicine for their primary health care needs when adopted outside of its traditional culture traditional medicine is often called alternative medicine practices known as traditional medicines include ayurveda siddha medicine unani ancient iranian medicine irani islamic medicine traditional chinese medicine traditional korean medicine acupuncture muti if and traditional african medicine core disciplines which study traditional medicine include herbalism ethnomedicine ethnobotany and medical anthropology the who notes however that inappropriate use of traditional medicines or practices can have negative or dangerous effects and that further research is needed to ascertain the efficacy and safety of several of the practices and medicinal plants used by traditional medicine systems the line between alternative medicine and quackery is a contentious subject traditional medicine may include formalized aspects of folk medicine that is to say longstanding remedies passed on and practised by lay people folk medicine consists of the healing practices and ideas of body physiology and health preservation known to some in a culture transmitted informally as general knowledge and practiced or applied by anyone in the culture having prior experience folk medicine may also be referred to as traditional medicine alternative medicine indigenous medicine or natural medicine these terms are often considered interchangeable even though some authors may prefer one
herbalism herbology or herbal medicine is use of plants for medicinal purposes and the study of such use plants have been the basis for medical treatments through much of human history and such traditional medicine is still widely practiced today modern medicine recognizes herbalism as a form of alternative medicine as the practice of herbalism is not strictly based on evidence gathered using the scientific method modern medicine does however make use of many plant derived compounds as the basis for evidence tested pharmaceutical drugs and phytotherapy works to apply modern standards of effectiveness testing to herbs and medicines that are derived from natural sources the scope of herbal medicine is sometimes extended to include fungal and bee products as well as minerals shells and certain animal parts archaeological evidence indicates that the use of medicinal plants dates at least to the paleolithic approximately years ago written evidence of herbal remedies dates back over years to the sumerians who created lists of plants a number of ancient cultures wrote on plants and their medical uses in ancient egypt herbs are mentioned in egyptian medical papyri depicted in tomb illustrations or on rare occasions found in medical jars containing trace amounts of herbs the earliest known greek herbals were those of theophrastus of eresos who in the th c b c wrote in greek historia plantarum of diocles of carystus who wrote during the rd century b c and of krateuas who wrote in the st century b c only a few fragments of these works have survived intact but from what remains scholars have noted that there is a large amount of overlap with the egyptian herbals seeds likely used for herbalism have been found in the archaeological sites of bronze age china dating from the shang dynasty over a
allergies also known as allergic diseases are a number of conditions caused by hypersensitivity of the immune system to something in the environment that usually causes little problem in most people these diseases include hay fever food allergies atopic dermatitis allergic asthma and anaphylaxis symptoms may include red eyes an itchy rash runny nose shortness of breath or swelling food intolerances and food poisoning are separate conditions common allergens include pollen and food metals and other substances may also cause problems food insect stings and medications are common causes of severe reactions their development is due to both genetic and environmental factors the underlying mechanism involves immunoglobulin e antibodies ige part of the body s immune system binding to an allergen and then to a receptor on mast cells or basophils where it triggers the release of inflammatory chemicals such as histamine diagnosis is typically based on a person s medical history further testing of the skin or blood may be useful in certain cases positive tests however may not mean there is a significant allergy to the substance in question early exposure to potential allergens may be protective treatments for allergies include avoiding known allergens and the use of medications such as steroids and antihistamines in severe reactions injectable adrenaline epinephrine is recommended allergen immunotherapy which gradually exposes people to larger and larger amounts of allergen is useful for some types of allergies such as hay fever and reactions to insect bites its use in food allergies is unclear allergies are common in the developed world about of people are affected by allergic rhinitis about of people have at least one food allergy and about have atopic dermatitis at some point in time depending on the country about and of people have asthma anaphylaxis occurs in between of people
infection is the invasion of an organism s body tissues by disease causing agents their multiplication and the reaction of host tissues to these organisms and the toxins they produce infectious disease also known as transmissible disease or communicable disease is illness resulting from an infection infections are caused by infectious agents including viruses viroids prions bacteria nematodes such as parasitic roundworms and pinworms arthropods such as ticks mites fleas and lice fungi such as ringworm and other macroparasites such as tapeworms and other helminths hosts can fight infections using their immune system mammalian hosts react to infections with an innate response often involving inflammation followed by an adaptive response specific medications used to treat infections include antibiotics antivirals antifungals antiprotozoals and antihelminthics infectious diseases resulted in million deaths in about of all deaths the branch of medicine that focuses on infections is referred to as infectious disease bacterial infections are classified by the causative agent as well as the symptoms and medical signs produced symptomatic infections are apparent whereas an infection that is active but does not produce noticeable symptoms may be called inapparent silent subclinical or occult an infection that is inactive or dormant is called a latent infection a short term infection is an acute infection a long term infection is a chronic infection among the vast varieties of microorganisms relatively few cause disease in otherwise healthy individuals infectious disease results from the interplay between those few pathogens and the defenses of the hosts they infect the appearance and severity of disease resulting from any pathogen depends upon the ability of that pathogen to damage the host as well as the ability of the host to resist the pathogen however a host s immune system can also cause damage to the host itself in an attempt to
vaccination is the administration of antigenic material a vaccine to stimulate an individual s immune system to develop adaptive immunity to a pathogen vaccines can prevent or ameliorate morbidity from infection when a sufficiently large percentage of a population has been vaccinated this results in herd immunity the effectiveness of vaccination has been widely studied and verified for example the influenza vaccine the hpv vaccine and the chicken pox vaccine vaccination is the most effective method of preventing infectious diseases widespread immunity due to vaccination is largely responsible for the worldwide eradication of smallpox and the restriction of diseases such as polio measles and tetanus from much of the world the world health organization who reports that licensed vaccines are currently available to prevent or contribute to the prevention and control of twenty five preventable infections the active agent of a vaccine may be intact but inactivated non infective or attenuated with reduced infectivity forms of the causative pathogens or purified components of the pathogen that have been found to be highly immunogenic e g outer coat proteins of a virus toxoids are produced for immunization against toxin based diseases such as the modification of tetanospasmin toxin of tetanus to remove its toxic effect but retain its immunogenic effect smallpox was most likely the first disease people tried to prevent by inoculating themselves and was the first disease for which a vaccine was produced the smallpox vaccine was discovered in by the british physician edward jenner although at least six people had used the same principles years earlier louis pasteur furthered the concept through his work in microbiology the immunization was called vaccination because it was derived from a virus affecting cows latin vacca cow smallpox was a contagious and deadly disease causing the deaths of of infected adults and
in nutrition diet is the sum of food consumed by a person or other organism dietary habits are the habitual decisions an individual or culture makes when choosing what foods to eat the word diet often implies the use of specific intake of nutrition for health or weight management reasons with the two often being related although humans are omnivores each culture and each person holds some food preferences or some food taboos this may be due to personal tastes or ethical reasons individual dietary choices may be more or less healthy complete nutrition requires ingestion and absorption of vitamins minerals and food energy in the form of carbohydrates proteins and fats dietary habits and choices play a significant role in the quality of life health and longevity some cultures and religions have restrictions concerning what foods are acceptable in their diet for example only kosher foods are permitted by judaism and halal foods by islam although buddhists are generally vegetarians the practice varies and meat eating may be permitted depending on the sects in hinduism vegetarianism is the ideal jains are strictly vegetarian and consumption of roots is not permitted many people choose to forgo food from animal sources to varying degrees e g flexitarianism vegetarianism veganism fruitarianism for health reasons issues surrounding morality or to reduce their personal impact on the environment although some of the public assumptions about which diets have lower impacts are known to be incorrect raw foodism is another contemporary trend these diets may require tuning or supplementation such as vitamins to meet ordinary nutritional needs a particular diet may be chosen to seek weight loss or weight gain changing a subject s dietary intake or going on a diet can change the energy balance and increase or decrease the amount of fat stored
tobacco smoking is the practice of burning tobacco and inhaling the smoke consisting of particle and gaseous phases a more broad definition may include simply taking tobacco smoke into the mouth and then releasing it as is done by some with tobacco pipes and cigars the practice was believed to begin as early as bc tobacco was introduced to eurasia in the late th century where it followed common trade routes the practice encountered criticism from its first import into the western world onwards but embedded itself in certain strata of a number of societies before becoming widespread upon the introduction of automated cigarette rolling apparatus german scientists identified a link between smoking and lung cancer in the late s leading to the first anti smoking campaign in modern history albeit one truncated by the collapse of the third reich at the end of the second world war in british researchers demonstrated a clear relationship between smoking and cancer evidence continued to mount in the s which prompted political action against the practice rates of consumption since in the developed world have either peaked or declined however they continue to climb in the developing world smoking is the most common method of consuming tobacco and tobacco is the most common substance smoked the agricultural product is often mixed with additives and then combusted the resulting smoke is then inhaled and the active substances absorbed through the alveoli in the lungs combustion was traditionally enhanced by addition of potassium or other nitrates citation needed many substances in cigarette smoke trigger chemical reactions in nerve endings which heighten heart rate alertness and reaction time among other things dopamine and endorphins are released which are often associated with pleasure as of to tobacco is used by about billion people about of men and
in medicine a family history consists of information about disorders from which the direct blood relatives of the patient have suffered genealogy typically includes very little of the medical history of the family but the medical history could be considered a specific subset of the total history of a family citation needed accurate knowledge of a patient s family history may identify a predisposition to developing certain illnesses which can inform clinical decisions and allow effective management or even prevention of conditions although sometimes neglected many healthcare professionals glean information on family morbidity of particular diseases e g cardiovascular diseases autoimmune disorders mental disorders diabetes cancer to assess whether a person is at risk of developing similar problems family histories may be imprecise because of various possible reasons some medical conditions are carried only by the female line such as x linked conditions and some mitochondrial diseases tracing female ancestors can be difficult in societies that change the woman s family name when she marries death records often give the maiden name of the deceased and possibly also the deceased s mother s maiden name some of the most useful records for tracing women are wills and probate records other medical conditions are carried only by the male line though these y linked conditions are rare owing to the small size of the y chromosome tracing male ancestors may be impossible if the conception is due to rape or sexual activity outside of a marriage not all positive family histories imply a genetic cause if various members of the same family have been exposed to the same toxin then they may develop similar symptoms without a genetic cause if a patient has a strong family history of a particular disorder or group of disorders this will generally lead to a
a family tree or pedigree chart is a chart representing family relationships in a conventional tree structure the more detailed family trees used in medicine and social work are known as genograms genealogical data can be represented in several formats for example as a pedigree or ancestry chart family trees are often presented with the oldest generations at the top and the newer generations at the bottom an ancestry chart which is a tree showing the ancestors of an individual will more closely resemble a tree in shape being wider at the top than the bottom in some ancestry charts an individual appears on the left and his or her ancestors appear to the right a descendancy chart which depicts all the descendants of an individual will be narrowest at the top family trees can have many themes one might encompass all direct descendants of a single figure or all known ancestors of a living person another might include all members of a particular surname e g male line descendants yet another approach is to construct a tree including all holders of a certain office such as kings of germany this relies on dynastic marriage to hold together the links between dynasties the image of the tree probably originated with one in medieval art of the tree of jesse used to illustrate the genealogy of christ in terms of a prophecy of isaiah isaiah possibly the first non biblical use and the first to show full family relationships rather than a purely patrilineal scheme was that involving family trees of the classical gods in boccaccio s genealogia deorum gentilium on the genealogy of the gods of the gentiles whose first version dates to citation needed one technique is a fan chart which features a half circle chart with concentric rings
weight loss in the context of medicine health or physical fitness refers to a reduction of the total body mass due to a mean loss of fluid body fat or adipose tissue and or lean mass namely bone mineral deposits muscle tendon and other connective tissue weight loss can either occur unintentionally due to malnourishment or an underlying disease or arise from a conscious effort to improve an actual or perceived overweight or obese state unexplained weight loss that is not caused by reduction in calorific intake or exercise is called cachexia and may be a symptom of a serious medical condition intentional weight loss is commonly referred to as slimming unintentional weight loss may result from loss of body fats loss of body fluids muscle atrophy or even a combination of these it is generally regarded as a medical problem when at least of a person s body weight has been lost in six months or in the last month another criterion used for assessing weight that is too low is the body mass index bmi however even lesser amounts of weight loss can be a cause for serious concern in a frail elderly person unintentional weight loss can occur because of an inadequately nutritious diet relative to a person s energy needs generally called malnutrition disease processes changes in metabolism hormonal changes medications or other treatments disease or treatment related dietary changes or reduced appetite associated with a disease or treatment can also cause unintentional weight loss poor nutrient utilization can lead to weight loss and can be caused by fistulae in the gastrointestinal tract diarrhea drug nutrient interaction enzyme depletion and muscle atrophy continuing weight loss may deteriorate into wasting a vaguely defined condition called cachexia cachexia differs from starvation in part because it involves a systemic
the heart is a muscular organ in humans and other animals which pumps blood through the blood vessels of the circulatory system blood provides the body with oxygen and nutrients and also assists in the removal of metabolic wastes the heart is located in the middle compartment of the mediastinum in the chest in humans other mammals and birds the heart is divided into four chambers upper left and right atria and lower left and right ventricles commonly the right atrium and ventricle are referred together as the right heart and their left counterparts as the left heart fish in contrast have two chambers an atrium and a ventricle while reptiles have three chambers in a healthy heart blood flows one way through the heart due to heart valves which prevent backflow the heart is enclosed in a protective sac the pericardium which also contains a small amount of fluid the wall of the heart is made up of three layers epicardium myocardium and endocardium the heart pumps blood through both circulatory systems blood low in oxygen from the systemic circulation enters the right atrium from the superior and inferior vena cavae and passes to the right ventricle from here it is pumped into the pulmonary circulation through the lungs where it receives oxygen and gives off carbon dioxide oxygenated blood then returns to the left atrium passes through the left ventricle and is pumped out through the aorta to the systemic circulation where the oxygen is used and metabolized to carbon dioxide in addition the blood carries nutrients from the liver and gastrointestinal tract to various organs of the body while transporting waste to the liver and kidneys citation needed normally with each heartbeat the right ventricle pumps the same amount of blood into the lungs as the left
the lungs are the primary organs of respiration in humans and many other animals including a few fish and some snails in mammals and most other vertebrates two lungs are located near the backbone on either side of the heart their function in the respiratory system is to extract oxygen from the atmosphere and transfer it into the bloodstream and to release carbon dioxide from the bloodstream into the atmosphere in a process of gas exchange respiration is driven by different muscular systems in different species mammals reptiles and birds use their musculoskeletal systems to support and foster breathing in early tetrapods air was driven into the lungs by the pharyngeal muscles via buccal pumping a mechanism still seen in amphibians in humans the primary muscle that drives breathing is the diaphragm humans have two lungs a right lung and a left lung they are situated within the thoracic cavity of the chest the right lung is bigger than the left lung as the left lung shares space in the chest with the heart the lungs together weigh approximately kilograms lb with the right lung weighing more than the left the lungs are part of the lower respiratory tract that begins at the trachea and branches into the bronchi and bronchioles and which receive air breathed in via the conducting zone these divide until air reaches microscopic alveoli which is where the process of gas exchange takes place together the lungs contain approximately kilometres mi of airways and to million alveoli the lungs are enclosed within a sac called the pleural sac which allows the inner and outer walls to slide over each other whilst breathing takes place without much friction this sac encloses each lung and also divides each lung into sections called lobes the right lung has three
the human gastrointestinal tract or gi tract or git is an organ system responsible for consuming and digesting foodstuffs absorbing nutrients and expelling waste the tract consists of the stomach and intestines and is divided into the upper and lower gastrointestinal tracts by the broadest definition the gi tract includes all structures between the mouth and the anus however the digestive system is a broader term that includes other structures including the digestive organs and their accessories the tract may also be divided into foregut midgut and hindgut reflecting the embryological origin of each segment the whole digestive tract is about nine metres feet long the gi tract releases hormones from enzymes to help regulate the digestive process these hormones including gastrin secretin cholecystokinin and ghrelin are mediated through either intracrine or autocrine mechanisms indicating that the cells releasing these hormones are conserved structures throughout evolution the structure and function can be described both as gross anatomy and as microscopic anatomy or histology the tract itself is divided into upper and lower tracts and the intestines small and large parts the upper gastrointestinal tract consists of the buccal cavity pharynx esophagus stomach and duodenum the exact demarcation between the upper and lower tracts is the suspensory ligament of the duodenum also known as the ligament of treitz this delineates the embryonic borders between the foregut and midgut and is also the division commonly used by clinicians to describe gastrointestinal bleeding as being of upper or lower origin upon dissection the duodenum may appear to be a unified organ but it is divided into four segments based upon function location and internal anatomy the four segments of the duodenum are as follows starting at the stomach and moving toward the jejunum bulb descending horizontal and ascending the suspensory ligament attaches the
the urinary system also known as the renal system consists of the kidneys ureters bladder and the urethra each kidney consists of millions of functional units called nephrons the purpose of the renal system is to eliminate wastes from the body regulate blood volume and blood pressure control levels of electrolytes and metabolites and regulate blood ph the kidneys have extensive blood supply via the renal arteries which leave the kidneys via the renal vein following filtration of blood and further processing wastes in the form of urine exit the kidney via the ureters tubes made of smooth muscle fibers that propel urine towards the urinary bladder where it is stored and subsequently expelled from the body by urination voiding the female and male urinary system are very similar differing only in the length of the urethra urine is formed in the kidneys through a filtration of blood the urine is then passed through the ureters to the bladder where it is stored during urination the urine is passed from the bladder through the urethra to the outside of the body milliliters ml of urine are normally produced every day in a healthy human this amount varies according to fluid intake and kidney function the urinary system refers to the structures that produce and conduct urine to the point of excretion the human body normally has two paired kidneys one on the left and one on the right urine is formed by nephrons the functional unit of the kidney and then flows through a system of converging tubules called collecting ducts the collecting ducts join together to form minor calyces then major calyces which ultimately join the pelvis of the kidney renal pelvis urine flows from the renal pelvis into the ureter a tube like structure that carries the urine
a medical sign is an objective indication of some medical fact or characteristic that may be detected by a physician during a physical examination of a patient for example whereas paresthesia is a symptom only the person experiencing it can directly observe their own tingling feeling erythema is a sign anyone can confirm that the skin is redder than usual symptoms and signs are often nonspecific but often combinations of them are at least suggestive of certain diagnoses helping to narrow down what may be wrong in other cases they are specific even to the point of being pathognomonic some signs may have no meaning to the patient and may even go unnoticed but may be meaningful and significant to the healthcare provider in assisting diagnosis examples of signs include elevated blood pressure a clubbing of the fingers which may be a sign of lung disease or many other things and arcus senilis the term sign is not to be confused with the term indication which denotes a valid reason for using some treatment the art of interpreting clinical signs was originally called semiotics a term now used for the study of sign communication in general in english this term then written semeiotics derived from the greek adjective semeiotikos to do with signs was first used in english in by henry stubbes to denote the branch of medical science relating to the interpretation of signs signs are different from symptoms the subjective experiences such as fatigue that patients might report to their examining physician for convenience signs are commonly distinguished from symptoms as follows both are something abnormal relevant to a potential medical condition but a symptom is experienced and reported by the patient while a sign is discovered by the physician during examination or by a clinical scientist by
uremia or uraemia see spelling differences can be translated as urea in the blood urea is one of the primary components of urine it can be defined as an excess of amino acid and protein metabolism end products such as urea and creatinine in the blood that would be normally excreted in the urine the uremic syndrome can be defined as the terminal clinical manifestation of kidney failure also called renal failure it is the signs symptoms and results from laboratory tests which result from inadequate excretory regulatory and endocrine function of the kidneys both uremia and the uremic syndrome have been used interchangeably to define a very high plasma urea concentration that is the result of renal failure the latter definition will be used for the rest of the article azotemia is another word that refers to high levels of urea but is used primarily when the abnormality can be measured chemically but is not yet so severe as to produce symptoms uremia is the pathological manifestations of severe azotemia there is no specific time for the onset of uremia for people with progressive loss of kidney function people with kidney function below i e a glomerular filtration rate gfr between and ml and years of age may have uremia to a degree this means an estimated million people in the united states with a gfr of less than ml have uremic symptoms the symptoms such as fatigue can be very vague making the diagnosis of impaired renal function difficult treatment would be to perform dialysis or a renal transplant classical signs of uremia are progressive weakness and easy fatigue loss of appetite due to nausea and vomiting muscle atrophy tremors abnormal mental function frequent shallow respiration and metabolic acidosis without intervention via dialysis or kidney transplant uremia due
diabetic ketoacidosis dka is a potentially life threatening complication in people with diabetes mellitus it happens predominantly in those with type diabetes but it can occur in those with type diabetes under certain circumstances dka results from a shortage of insulin in response the body switches to burning fatty acids and producing acidic ketone bodies that cause most of the symptoms and complications dka may be the first symptom of previously undiagnosed diabetes but it may also occur in people known to have diabetes as a result of a variety of causes such as intercurrent illness or poor compliance with insulin therapy vomiting dehydration deep gasping breathing confusion and occasionally coma are typical symptoms dka is diagnosed with blood and urine tests it is distinguished from other rarer forms of ketoacidosis by the presence of high blood sugar levels treatment involves intravenous fluids to correct dehydration insulin to suppress the production of ketone bodies treatment for any underlying causes such as infections and close observation to prevent and identify complications dka is a medical emergency and without treatment it can lead to death dka was first described in until the introduction of insulin therapy in the s it was almost universally fatal it now carries a mortality of less than with adequate and timely treatment the symptoms of an episode of diabetic ketoacidosis usually evolve over the period of about hours predominant symptoms are nausea and vomiting pronounced thirst excessive urine production and abdominal pain that may be severe those who measure their glucose levels themselves may notice hyperglycemia high blood sugar levels in severe dka breathing becomes labored and of a deep gasping character a state referred to as kussmaul respiration the abdomen may be tender to the point that an acute abdomen may be suspected such as acute
in medicine inspection latin word inspectio or the act of beholding is the thorough and unhurried visualization of the client this requires the use of the naked eye during inspection the examiner observes external signs gross deviation in medical practice inspection is however not limited to visual information alone inspection also involves
palpation is the process of using one s hands to examine the body especially while perceiving diagnosing a disease or illness usually performed by a healthcare practitioner it is also the process of feeling an object in or on the body to determine its size shape firmness or location such as a veterinarian would check feel the stomach of a pregnant animal to ensure good health and successful delivery palpation is used by physicians as well as chiropracters massage therapists physical therapists osteopaths and occupational therapists to assess the texture of a patient s tissue such as swelling or muscle tone to locate the spatial coordinates of particular anatomical landmarks e g to assess range and quality of joint motion and assess tenderness through tissue deformation e g provoking pain with pressure or stretching in summary palpation might be used either to determine painful areas and to qualify pain felt by patients or to locate three dimensional coordinates of anatomical landmarks to quantify some aspects of the palpated subject palpation is typically used for thoracic and abdominal examinations but can also be used to diagnose edema and to measure the pulse it is used by veterinarians to check animals for pregnancy and by midwives to determine the position of a fetus quantitative palpation of anatomical landmarks for measurements must occur according to strict protocols if one wishes to achieve reproducible measurements palpation protocols are usually based on well described definitions for the location of anatomical usually skeletal landmarks locating anatomical landmarks can be performed using two palpation protocols manual palpation that allows spatial location of landmarks using hands combined or not with three dimensional d digitizing and virtual palpation on d computer models obtained for example from medical imaging manual palpation of skeletal landmarks combined with d digitizing see text
percussion is a method of tapping on a surface to determine the underlying structure and is used in clinical examinations to assess the condition of the thorax or abdomen it is one of the five methods of clinical examination together with inspection palpation auscultation and inquiry it is done with the middle finger of one hand tapping on the middle finger of the other hand using a wrist action the nonstriking finger known as the pleximeter is placed firmly on the body over tissue when percussing boney areas such as the clavicle the pleximeter can be omitted and the bone is tapped directly such as when percussing an apical cavitary lung lesion typical of tb there are two types of percussion direct which uses only one or two fingers and indirect which uses the middle flexor finger there are four types of percussion sounds resonant hyper resonant stony dull or dull a dull sound indicates the presence of a solid mass under the surface a more resonant sound indicates hollow air containing structures as well as producing different notes which can be heard they also produce different sensations in the pleximeter finger percussion was at first used to distinguish between empty and filled barrels of liquor and dr leopold auenbrugger is said to be the person who introduced the technique to modern medicine although this method was used by avicenna about years before that for medical practice such as using percussion over the stomach to show how full it is and to distinguish between ascites and tympanites it is used to diagnose pneumothorax emphysema and other diseases it can be used to assess the respiratory mobility of the thorax it is used to find whether any organ is enlarged and similar assessing for organomegaly it is based on the principle
auscultation based on the latin verb auscultare to listen is listening to the internal sounds of the body usually using a stethoscope auscultation is performed for the purposes of examining the circulatory and respiratory systems heart and breath sounds as well as the gastrointestinal system bowel sounds the term was introduced by ren th ophile hyacinthe la nnec the act of listening to body sounds for diagnostic purposes has its origin further back in history possibly as early as ancient egypt la nnec s contributions were refining the procedure linking sounds with specific pathological changes in the chest and inventing a suitable instrument the stethoscope in the process originally there was a distinction between immediate auscultation unaided and mediate auscultation using an instrument auscultation is a skill that requires substantial clinical experience a fine stethoscope and good listening skills health professionals doctors nurses etc listen to three main organs and organ systems during auscultation the heart the lungs and the gastrointestinal system when auscultating the heart doctors listen for abnormal sounds including heart murmurs gallops and other extra sounds coinciding with heartbeats heart rate is also noted when listening to lungs breath sounds such as wheezes crepitations and crackles are identified the gastrointestinal system is auscultated to note the presence of bowel sounds electronic stethoscopes can be recording devices and can provide noise reduction and signal enhancement this is helpful for purposes of telemedicine remote diagnosis and teaching this opened the field to computer aided auscultation the sounds of auscultation can be depicted using symbols to produce an auscultogram it is used in cardiology training immediate auscultation is an antiquated medical term for listening auscultation to the internal sounds of the body directly placing the ear on the body it is opposed to mediate auscultation using an instrument mediate i
blood pressure bp is the pressure exerted by circulating blood upon the walls of blood vessels when used without further specification blood pressure usually refers to the arterial pressure in the systemic circulation it is usually measured at a person s upper arm blood pressure is usually expressed in terms of the systolic maximum pressure over diastolic minimum pressure and is measured in millimeters of mercury mm hg it is one of the vital signs along with respiratory rate heart rate oxygen saturation and body temperature normal resting blood pressure in an adult is approximately mm hg blood pressure varies depending on situation activity and disease states it is regulated by the nervous and endocrine systems blood pressure that is low due to a disease state is called hypotension and pressure that is consistently high is hypertension both have many causes which can range from mild to severe both may be of sudden onset or of long duration long term hypertension is a risk factor for many diseases including kidney failure heart disease and stroke long term hypertension is more common than long term hypotension in western countries long term hypertension often goes undetected because of infrequent monitoring and the absence of symptoms the table presented here shows the classification of blood pressure adopted by the american heart association for adults who are years and older it assumes the values are a result of averaging blood pressure readings measured at two or more visits to the doctor in the uk clinic blood pressures are usually categorised into three groups low or lower normal between and and high or higher blood pressure fluctuates from minute to minute and normally shows a circadian rhythm over a hour period with highest readings in the afternoons and lowest readings at night loss of the
in medicine a pulse represents the tactile arterial palpation of the heartbeat by trained fingertips the pulse may be palpated in any place that allows an artery to be compressed against a bone such as at the neck carotid artery on the inside of the elbow brachial artery at the wrist radial artery at the groin femoral artery behind the knee popliteal artery near the ankle joint posterior tibial artery and on foot dorsalis pedis artery pulse or the count of arterial pulse per minute is equivalent to measuring the heart rate the heart rate can also be measured by listening to the heart beat directly auscultation traditionally using a stethoscope and counting it for a minute the radial pulse is commonly measured using three fingers this has a reason the finger closest to the heart is used to occlude the pulse pressure the middle finger is used get a crude estimate of the blood pressure and the finger most distal to the heart usually the ring finger is used to nullify the effect of the ulnar pulse as the two arteries are connected via the palmar arches the study of the pulse is known as sphygmology the pulse is a decidedly low tech and high yield and antiquated term still useful at the bedside in an age of computational analysis of cardiac performance claudius galen was perhaps the first physiologist to describe the pulse the pulse is an expedient tactile method of determination of systolic blood pressure to a trained observer diastolic blood pressure is non palpable and unobservable by tactile methods occurring between heartbeats pressure waves generated by the heart in systole moves the arterial walls forward movement of blood occurs when the boundaries are pliable and compliant these properties form enough to create a palpable pressure wave
oxygen saturation symbol so is a relative measure of the amount of oxygen that is dissolved or carried in a given medium it can be measured with a dissolved oxygen probe such as an oxygen sensor or an optode in liquid media usually water the standard unit of oxygen saturation is percent oxygen saturation can be measured regionally and noninvasively arterial oxygen saturation sao is commonly measured using pulse oximetry tissue saturation at peripheral scale can be measured using nirs this technique can be applied on both muscle and brain in medicine oxygen saturation refers to oxygenation or when oxygen molecules o enter the tissues of the body in this case blood is oxygenated in the lungs where oxygen molecules travel from the air and into the blood oxygen saturation o sats is a measure the percentage of hemoglobin binding sites in the bloodstream occupied by oxygen fish invertebrates plants and aerobic bacteria all require oxygen for respiration in aquatic environments oxygen saturation is a ratio of the concentration of dissolved oxygen o in the water to the maximum amount of oxygen that will dissolve in the water at that temperature and pressure under stable equilibrium well aerated water such as a fast moving stream without oxygen producers or consumers is saturated it is possible for stagnant water to become somewhat supersaturated with oxygen i e reach more than saturation either because of the presence of photosynthetic aquatic oxygen producers or because of a slow equilibration after a change of atmospheric conditions stagnant water in the presence of decaying matter will typically have an oxygen concentration much less than citation needed environmental oxygenation can be important to the sustainability of a particular ecosystem refer to for a table of maximum equilibrium dissolved oxygen concentration versus temperature at atmospheric pressure the
in medicine nail clubbing also known as drumstick fingers and watch glass nails is a deformity of the fingers and fingernails associated with a number of diseases mostly of the heart and lungs hippocrates was probably the first to document clubbing as a sign of disease and the phenomenon is therefore occasionally called hippocratic fingers idiopathic clubbing can also occur but is rare clubbing may be present in one of five stages schamroth s test or schamroth s window test originally demonstrated by south african cardiologist leo schamroth on himself is a popular test for clubbing when the distal phalanges bones nearest the fingertips of corresponding fingers of opposite hands are directly opposed place fingernails of same finger on opposite hands against each other nail to nail a small diamond shaped window is normally apparent between the nailbeds if this window is obliterated the test is positive and clubbing is present when clubbing is encountered in patients doctors will seek to identify its cause they usually accomplish this by obtaining a medical history particular attention is paid to lung heart and gastrointestinal conditions and conducting a clinical examination which may disclose associated features relevant to a diagnosis additional studies such as a chest x ray and a chest ct scan may also be performed although many diseases are associated with clubbing particularly lung diseases the reports are fairly anecdotal prospective studies of patients presenting with clubbing have not yet been performed and hence there is no conclusive evidence of these associations clubbing is associated with nail clubbing is not specific to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease copd therefore in patients with copd with significant degrees of clubbing a search for signs of bronchogenic carcinoma or other causes of clubbing might be indicated a special form of clubbing is hypertrophic pulmonary osteoarthropathy
the human skin is the outer covering of the body in humans it is the largest organ of the integumentary system the skin has multiple layers of ectodermal tissue and guards the underlying muscles bones ligaments and internal organs human skin is similar to that of most other mammals except that it is not protected by a fur though nearly all human skin is covered with hair follicles it can appear hairless there are two general types of skin hairy and glabrous skin the adjective cutaneous literally means of the skin from latin cutis skin because it interfaces with the environment skin plays a key immunity role in protecting the body against pathogens and excessive water loss its other functions are insulation temperature regulation sensation synthesis of vitamin d and the protection of vitamin b folates severely damaged skin will try to heal by forming scar tissue this is often discolored and depigmented in humans skin pigmentation varies among populations and skin type can range from dry to oily such skin variety provides a rich and diverse habitat for bacteria that number roughly species from phyla present on the human skin skin has mesodermal cells pigmentation such as melanin provided by melanocytes which absorb some of the potentially dangerous ultraviolet radiation uv in sunlight it also contains dna repair enzymes that help reverse uv damage such that people lacking the genes for these enzymes suffer high rates of skin cancer one form predominantly produced by uv light malignant melanoma is particularly invasive causing it to spread quickly and can often be deadly human skin pigmentation varies among populations in a striking manner this has led to the classification of people s on the basis of skin color the skin is the largest organ in the human body for the average
the ear is the organ that detects sound it not only receives sound but also aids in balance and body position the ear is part of the auditory system often the entire organ is considered the ear though it may also be considered just the visible portion in most mammals the visible ear is a flap of tissue that is also called the pinna or auricle in humans and is the first of many steps in hearing vertebrates have a pair of ears placed somewhat symmetrically on opposite sides of the head this arrangement aids in the ability to localize sound sources the shape of the outer ear of mammals varies widely across species however the inner workings of mammalian ears including humans are very similar the outer ear is the most external portion of the ear the outer ear includes the fleshy visible outer ear called the pinna or auricle the ear canal and the outer layer of the tympanic membrane also known as the ear drum the outer ear is the only visible portion of the ear in humans and almost all vertebrates and consequently the word ear may be used to refer to the pinna alone the auricle consists of the curving outer rim the helix the inner curved rim the antihelix and opens into the ear canal properly called the external acoustic meatus the tragus protrudes and partially obscures the ear canal the ear canal stretches for a distance of about inch and consists of an inner portion surrounded by bone and an outer portion surrounded by cartilage the skin surrounding the external acoustic meatus contains glands that produce ear wax cerumen the ear canal ends at the external surface of the ear drum tympanic membrane two sets of muscles are associated with the outer ear
the circulatory system also called the cardiovascular system or the vascular system is an organ system that permits blood to circulate and transport nutrients such as amino acids and electrolytes oxygen carbon dioxide hormones and blood cells to and from the cells in the body to provide nourishment and help in fighting diseases stabilize temperature and ph and maintain homeostasis the study of the blood flow is called hemodynamics the study of the properties of the blood flow is called hemorheology the circulatory system is often seen to comprise both the cardiovascular system which distributes blood and the lymphatic system which circulates lymph these are two separate systems the passage of lymph for example takes a lot longer than that of blood blood is a fluid consisting of plasma red blood cells white blood cells and platelets that is circulated by the heart through the vertebrate vascular system carrying oxygen and nutrients to and waste materials away from all body tissues lymph is essentially recycled excess blood plasma after it has been filtered from the interstitial fluid between cells and returned to the lymphatic system the cardiovascular from latin words meaning heart and vessel system comprises the blood heart and blood vessels the lymph lymph nodes and lymph vessels form the lymphatic system which returns filtered blood plasma from the interstitial fluid between cells as lymph while humans as well as other vertebrates have a closed cardiovascular system meaning that the blood never leaves the network of arteries veins and capillaries some invertebrate groups have an open cardiovascular system the lymphatic system on the other hand is an open system providing an accessory route for excess interstitial fluid to be returned to the blood the more primitive diploblastic animal phyla lack circulatory systems the essential components of the human cardiovascular

the blood vessels are the part of the circulatory system that transports blood throughout the human body there are three major types of blood vessels the arteries which carry the blood away from the heart the capillaries which enable the actual exchange of water and chemicals between the blood and the tissues and the veins which carry blood from the capillaries back toward the heart the word vascular meaning relating to the blood vessels is derived from the latin vas meaning vessel the arteries and veins have three layers but the middle layer is thicker in the arteries than it is in the veins capillaries consist of little more than a layer of endothelium and occasional connective tissue when blood vessels connect to form a region of diffuse vascular supply it is called an anastomosis pl anastomoses anastomoses provide critical alternative routes for blood to flow in case of blockages there is a layer of muscle surrounding the arteries and the veins which help contract and expand the vessels this creates enough pressure for blood to be pumped around the body blood vessels are part of the circulatory system together with the heart and the blood there are various kinds of blood vessels they are roughly grouped as arterial and venous determined by whether the blood in it is flowing away from arterial or toward venous the heart the term arterial blood is nevertheless used to indicate blood high in oxygen although the pulmonary artery carries venous blood and blood flowing in the pulmonary vein is rich in oxygen this is because they are carrying the blood to and from the lungs respectively to be oxygenated blood vessels do not actively engage in the transport of blood they have no appreciable peristalsis but arteries and veins to a degree can
the respiratory system called also respiratory apparatus ventilatory system is a biological system consisting of specific organs and structures used for the process of respiration in an organism the respiratory system is involved in the intake and exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide between an organism and the environment in air breathing vertebrates like human beings respiration takes place in the respiratory organs called lungs the passage of air into the lungs to supply the body with oxygen is known as inhalation and the passage of air out of the lungs to expel carbon dioxide is known as exhalation this process is collectively called breathing or ventilation in humans and other mammals the anatomical features of the respiratory system include trachea bronchi bronchioles lungs and diaphragm molecules of oxygen and carbon dioxide are passively exchanged by diffusion between the gaseous external environment and the blood this exchange process occurs in the alveoli air sacs in the lungs in fish and many invertebrates respiration takes place through the gills other animals such as insects have respiratory systems with very simple anatomical features and in amphibians even the skin plays a vital role in gas exchange plants also have respiratory systems but the directionality of gas exchange can be opposite to that in animals the respiratory system in plants also includes anatomical features such as holes on the undersides of leaves known as stomata horses are obligate nasal breathers which means that they are different from many other mammals because they do not have the option of breathing through their mouths and must take in oxygen through their noses the elephant is the only animal known to have no pleural space rather the parietal and visceral pleura are both composed of dense connective tissue and joined to each other via loose connective
