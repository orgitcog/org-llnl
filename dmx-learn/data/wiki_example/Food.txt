food is any substance consumed to provide nutritional support for the body it is usually of plant or animal origin and contains essential nutrients such as fats proteins vitamins or minerals the substance is ingested by an organism and assimilated by the organism s cells to provide energy maintain life or stimulate growth historically people secured food through two methods hunting and gathering and agriculture today the majority of the food energy required by the ever increasing population of the world is supplied by the food industry food safety and food security are monitored by agencies like the international association for food protection world resources institute world food programme food and agriculture organization and international food information council they address issues such as sustainability biological diversity climate change nutritional economics population growth water supply and access to food the right to food is a human right derived from the international covenant on economic social and cultural rights icescr recognizing the right to an adequate standard of living including adequate food as well as the fundamental right to be free from hunger most food has its origin in plants some food is obtained directly from plants but even animals that are used as food sources are raised by feeding them food derived from plants cereal grain is a staple food that provides more food energy worldwide than any other type of crop corn maize wheat and rice in all of their varieties account for of all grain production worldwide most of the grain that is produced worldwide is fed to livestock some foods not from animal or plant sources include various edible fungi especially mushrooms fungi and ambient bacteria are used in the preparation of fermented and pickled foods like leavened bread alcoholic drinks cheese pickles kombucha and yogurt another example
food is any substance that can be consumed by living organisms especially by eating in order to sustain life food may also refer to

green algae land plants embryophytes nematophytes plants also called green plants are multicellular eukaryotes of the kingdom plantae they form an unranked clade viridiplantae latin for green plants that includes the flowering plants conifers and other gymnosperms ferns clubmosses hornworts liverworts mosses and the green algae green plants excludes the red and brown algae the fungi archaea bacteria and animals green plants have cell walls with cellulose and obtain most of their energy from sunlight via photosynthesis by primary chloroplasts derived from endosymbiosis with cyanobacteria their chloroplasts contain chlorophylls a and b which gives them their green color some plants are parasitic and have lost the ability to produce normal amounts of chlorophyll or to photosynthesize plants are also characterized by sexual reproduction modular clarification needed and indeterminate growth and an alternation of generations although asexual reproduction is also common precise numbers are difficult to determine but as of update there are thought to be thousand species of plants of which the great majority some thousand are seed plants see the table below green plants provide most of the world s molecular oxygen and are the basis of most of the earth s ecologies especially on land plants that produce grains fruits and vegetables form mankind s basic foodstuffs and have been domesticated for millennia plants are used as ornaments and until recently and in great variety they have served as the source of most medicines and drugs the scientific study of plants is known as botany a branch of biology plants are one of the two groups into which all living things were traditionally divided the other is animals the division goes back at least as far as aristotle bc bc who distinguished between plants which generally do not move and animals which often are mobile to catch their
animals are multicellular eukaryotic organisms of the kingdom animalia also called metazoa all animals are motile meaning they can move spontaneously and independently at some point in their lives their body plan eventually becomes fixed as they develop although some undergo a process of metamorphosis later on in their lives all animals are heterotrophs they must ingest other organisms or their products for sustenance most known animal phyla appeared in the fossil record as marine species during the cambrian explosion about million years ago animals are divided into various sub groups some of which are vertebrates birds mammals amphibians reptiles fish molluscs clams oysters octopuses squid snails arthropods millipedes centipedes insects spiders scorpions crabs lobsters shrimp annelids earthworms leeches sponges and jellyfish the word animal comes from the latin word animalis meaning having breath having soul and living beings in everyday non scientific usage the word excludes humans that is animal is often used to refer only to non human members of the kingdom animalia often only closer relatives of humans such as mammals or mammals and other vertebrates are meant the biological definition of the word refers to all members of the kingdom animalia encompassing creatures as diverse as sponges jellyfish insects and humans aristotle divided the living world between animals and plants and this was followed by carl linnaeus in the first hierarchical classification in linnaeus s original scheme the animals were one of three kingdoms divided into the classes of vermes insecta pisces amphibia aves and mammalia since then the last four have all been subsumed into a single phylum the chordata whereas the various other forms have been separated out in ernst haeckel divided the animal kingdom into two subkingdoms metazoa multicellular animals and protozoa single celled animals the protozoa were later moved to the kingdom
nutrients are components in foods that an organism uses to survive and grow macronutrients provide the bulk energy an organism s metabolic system needs to function while micronutrients provide the necessary cofactors for metabolism to be carried out both types of nutrients can be acquired from the environment micronutrients are used to build and repair tissues and to regulate body processes while macronutrients are converted to and used for energy methods of nutrient intake are different for plants and animals plants take in nutrients directly from the soil through their roots and from the atmosphere through their leaves animals and protists have specialized digestive systems that work to break down macronutrients for energy and utilize micronutrients for both metabolism and anabolism constructive synthesis in the body organic nutrients consist of carbohydrates fats proteins or their building blocks amino acids and vitamins inorganic chemical compounds such as dietary minerals water and oxygen may also be considered nutrients a nutrient is considered essential if it must be obtained from an external source either because the organism cannot synthesize it or because insufficient quantities are produced nutrients needed in very small amounts are called micronutrients while those needed in large quantities are called macronutrients the effects of nutrients are dose dependent shortages are called deficiencies macronutrients are defined in several different ways although alcohol provides energy and can thus be compared to macronutrients it is not a substance that is essential for normal function the acetic acid in vinegar also provides a similar amount of energy per gram but again it is not a nutrient because it is not essential for normal function fat has an energy content of kcal g kj g proteins and carbohydrates kcal g kj g ethanol grain alcohol has an energy content of kcal g kj g plants
fat is one of the three main macronutrients fat carbohydrate and protein fats also known as triglycerides are esters of three fatty acid chains and the alcohol glycerol the terms oil fat and lipid are often confused oil normally refers to a fat with short or unsaturated fatty acid chains that is liquid at room temperature while fat may specifically refer to fats that are solids at room temperature lipid is the general term as a lipid is not necessarily a triglyceride fats like other lipids are generally hydrophobic and are soluble in organic solvents and insoluble in water fat is an important foodstuff for many forms of life and fats serve both structural and metabolic functions they are necessary part of the diet of most heterotrophs including humans some fatty acids that are set free by the digestion of fats are called essential because they cannot be synthesized in the body from simpler constituents there are two essential fatty acids efas in human nutrition alpha linolenic acid an omega fatty acid and linoleic acid an omega fatty acid other lipids needed by the body can be synthesized from these and other fats fats and other lipids are broken down in the body by enzymes called lipases produced in the pancreas fats and oils are categorized according to the number and bonding of the carbon atoms in the aliphatic chain fats that are saturated fats have no double bonds between the carbons in the chain unsaturated fats have one or more double bonded carbons in the chain the nomenclature is based on the non acid non carbonyl end of the chain this end is called the omega end or the n end thus alpha linolenic acid is called an omega fatty acid because the rd carbon from that end is
proteins are essential nutrients for the human body they are one of the building blocks of body tissue and can also serve as a fuel source as a fuel proteins contain kcal per gram just like carbohydrates and unlike lipids which contain kcal per gram the most important aspect and defining characteristic of protein from a nutritional standpoint is its amino acid composition proteins are polymer chains made of amino acids linked together by peptide bonds during human digestion proteins are broken down in the stomach to smaller polypeptide chains via hydrochloric acid and protease actions this is crucial for the synthesis of the essential amino acids that cannot be biosynthesized by the body there are nine essential amino acids which humans must obtain from their diet in order to prevent protein energy malnutrition they are phenylalanine valine threonine tryptophan methionine leucine isoleucine lysine and histidine there are five dispensable amino acids which humans are able to synthesize in the body these five are alanine aspartic acid asparagine glutamic acid and serine there are six conditionally essential amino acids whose synthesis can be limited under special pathophysiological conditions such as prematurity in the infant or individuals in severe catabolic distress these six are arginine cysteine glycine glutamine proline and tyrosine humans need the essential amino acids in certain ratios some protein sources contain amino acids in a more or less complete sense this has given rise to various ranking systems for protein sources as described in the article sources of protein include grains legumes and nuts as well as animal sources such as meats dairy products fish and eggs vegetarians and vegans can get enough essential amino acids by eating a variety of plant proteins it is commonly believed that athletes should consume a higher than normal protein intake to
a vitamin us va t m n and uk v t m n is an organic compound and a vital nutrient that an organism requires in limited amounts an organic chemical compound or related set of compounds is called a vitamin when the organism cannot synthesize the compound in sufficient quantities and it must be obtained through the diet thus the term vitamin is conditional upon the circumstances and the particular organism for example ascorbic acid one form of vitamin c is a vitamin for humans but not for most other animal organisms supplementation is important for the treatment of certain health problems but there is little evidence of nutritional benefit when used by otherwise healthy people by convention the term vitamin includes neither other essential nutrients such as dietary minerals essential fatty acids or essential amino acids which are needed in greater amounts than vitamins nor the great number of other nutrients that promote health and are required less often to maintain the health of the organism thirteen vitamins are universally recognized at present vitamins are classified by their biological and chemical activity not their structure thus each vitamin refers to a number of vitamer compounds that all show the biological activity associated with a particular vitamin such a set of chemicals is grouped under an alphabetized vitamin generic descriptor title such as vitamin a which includes the compounds retinal retinol and four known carotenoids vitamers by definition are convertible to the active form of the vitamin in the body and are sometimes inter convertible to one another as well vitamins have diverse biochemical functions some such as vitamin d have hormone like functions as regulators of mineral metabolism or regulators of cell and tissue growth and differentiation such as some forms of vitamin a others function as antioxidants
a mineral is a naturally occurring substance representable by a chemical formula that is usually solid and inorganic and has a crystal structure it is different from a rock which can be an aggregate of minerals or non minerals and does not have a specific chemical composition the exact definition of a mineral is under debate especially with respect to the requirement a valid species be abiogenic and to a lesser extent with regard to it having an ordered atomic structure citation needed the study of minerals is called mineralogy there are over known mineral species over of these have been approved by the international mineralogical association ima the silicate minerals compose over of the earth s crust the diversity and abundance of mineral species is controlled by the earth s chemistry silicon and oxygen constitute approximately of the earth s crust which translates directly into the predominance of silicate minerals minerals are distinguished by various chemical and physical properties differences in chemical composition and crystal structure distinguish various species and these properties in turn are influenced by the mineral s geological environment of formation changes in the temperature pressure or bulk composition of a rock mass cause changes in its minerals minerals can be described by various physical properties which relate to their chemical structure and composition common distinguishing characteristics include crystal structure and habit hardness lustre diaphaneity colour streak tenacity cleavage fracture parting and specific gravity more specific tests for minerals include magnetism taste or smell radioactivity and reaction to acid minerals are classified by key chemical constituents the two dominant systems are the dana classification and the strunz classification the silicate class of minerals is subdivided into six subclasses by the degree of polymerization in the chemical structure all silicate minerals have a base unit of a
ingestion is the consumption of a substance by an organism in animals it normally is accomplished by taking in the substance through the mouth into the gastrointestinal tract such as through eating or drinking in single celled organisms ingestion can take place through taking the substance through the cell membrane besides nutritional items other substances which may be ingested include medication where ingestion is termed oral administration recreational drugs and substances considered inedible such as foreign bodies or excrement ingestion is a common route taken by pathogenic organisms and poisons entering the body ingestion can also refer to a mechanism picking up something and making it enter an internal hollow of that mechanism e g a grille was fitted to prevent the pump from ingesting driftwood some pathogens are transmitted via ingestion including viruses bacteria and parasites most commonly this takes place via the faecal oral route an intermediate step is often involved such as drinking water contaminated by faeces or food prepared by workers who fail to practice adequate hand washing and is more common in regions where untreated sewage is common diseases transmitted via the fecal oral route include hepatitis a polio and cholera some pathogenic organisms are typically ingested by other routes disk batteries also called button cells are often mistakenly ingested particularly by children and the elderly they may be mistaken for a medication pill because of their size and shape or they may be swallowed after being held in the mouth while the battery is being changed battery ingestion can cause medical problems including blocked airway vomiting irritability persistent drooling and rash due to nickel metal allergy pica is an abnormal appetite for non nutritive objects or for food items in a form not normally eaten such as flour coprophagia is the consumption of feces
in biology an organism is any contiguous living system such as an animal plant or bacterium more than of all species amounting to over five billion species that ever lived on earth are estimated to be extinct estimates on the number of earth s current species range from million to million of which about million have been documented and over percent have not yet been described all known types of organisms are capable of some degree of response to stimuli reproduction growth and development and homeostasis an organism consists of one or more cells when it has one cell is a unicellular organism and when it has more than one it is known as a multicellular organism most unicellular organisms are of microscopic size and are thus classified as microorganisms humans are multicellular organisms composed of many trillions of cells grouped into specialized tissues and organs an organism may be either a prokaryote or a eukaryote prokaryotes are represented by two separate domains the bacteria and archaea eukaryotic organisms are characterized by the presence of a membrane bound cell nucleus and contain additional membrane bound compartments called organelles such as mitochondria in animals and plants and plastids in plants and algae all generally considered to be derived from endosymbiotic bacteria fungi animals and plants are examples of kingdoms of organisms within the eukaryotes in thomas cavalier smith author of branching order of bacterial phyla proposed a clade neomura which groups together the archaea and eukarya neomura is thought to have evolved from bacteria more specifically from actinobacteria the term organism from greek organismos from organon i e instrument implement tool organ of sense or apprehension first appeared in the english language in and took on its current definition by oxford english dictionary it is directly related to the term organization
the cell from latin cella meaning small room is the basic structural functional and biological unit of all known living organisms cells are the smallest unit of life that can replicate independently and are often called the building blocks of life the study of cells is called cell biology cells consist of cytoplasm enclosed within a membrane which contains many biomolecules such as proteins and nucleic acids organisms can be classified as unicellular consisting of a single cell including bacteria or multicellular including plants and animals while the number of cells in plants and animals varies from species to species humans contain more than trillion cells most plant and animal cells are visible only under the microscope with dimensions between and micrometres the cell was discovered by robert hooke in who named the biological unit for its resemblance to cells inhabited by christian monks in a monastery cell theory first developed in by matthias jakob schleiden and theodor schwann states that all organisms are composed of one or more cells that cells are the fundamental unit of structure and function in all living organisms that all cells come from preexisting cells and that all cells contain the hereditary information necessary for regulating cell functions and for transmitting information to the next generation of cells cells emerged on earth at least billion years ago cells are of two types eukaryotic which contain a nucleus and prokaryotic which do not prokaryotes are single celled organisms while eukaryotes can be either single celled or multicellular prokaryotic cells were the first form of life on earth characterised by having vital biological processes including cell signaling and being self sustaining they are simpler and smaller than eukaryotic cells and lack membrane bound organelles such as the nucleus prokaryotes include two of the domains of life
in physics energy is a property of objects which can be transferred to other objects or converted into different forms but cannot be created or destroyed the ability of a system to perform work is a common description but it is difficult to give one single comprehensive definition of energy because of its many forms for instance in si units energy is measured in joules and one joule is defined mechanically being the energy transferred to an object by the mechanical work of moving it a distance of metre against a force of newton note however there are many other definitions of energy depending on the context such as thermal energy radiant energy electromagnetic nuclear etc where definitions are derived that are the most convenient common energy forms include the kinetic energy of a moving object the radiant energy carried by light the potential energy stored by an object s position in a force field gravitational electric or magnetic elastic energy stored by stretching solid objects chemical energy released when a fuel burns and the thermal energy due to an object s temperature all of the many forms of energy are convertible to other kinds of energy and obey the law of conservation of energy which says that energy can be neither created nor be destroyed however it can change from one form to another for closed systems with no external source or sink of energy the first law of thermodynamics states that a system s energy is constant unless energy is transferred in or out by mechanical work or heat and that no energy is lost in transfer this means that it is impossible to create or destroy energy the second law of thermodynamics states that all systems doing work always lose some energy as waste heat this creates
a hunter gatherer or early human society is one in which most or all food is obtained from wild plants and animals in contrast to agricultural societies which rely mainly on domesticated species hunting and gathering was humanity s first and most successful adaptation occupying at least percent of human history and years ago all lived this way following the invention of agriculture hunter gatherers have been displaced or conquered by farming or pastoralist groups in most parts of the world only a few contemporary societies are classified as hunter gatherers and many supplement their foraging activity with horticulture and or keeping animals in the s lewis binford suggested that early humans were obtaining meat via scavenging not hunting early humans in the lower paleolithic lived in forests and woodlands which allowed them to collect seafood eggs nuts and fruits besides scavenging rather than killing large animals for meat according to this view they used carcasses of such animals that had either been killed by predators or that had died of natural causes according to the endurance running hypothesis long distance running as in persistence hunting a method still practiced by some hunter gatherer groups in modern times was likely the driving evolutionary force leading to the evolution of certain human characteristics this hypothesis does not necessarily contradict the scavenging hypothesis both subsistence strategies could have been in use sequentially alternating or even simultaneously hunting and gathering was presumably the subsistence strategy employed by human societies beginning some million years ago by homo erectus and from its appearance some million years ago by homo sapiens it remained the only mode of subsistence until the end of the mesolithic period some years ago and after this was replaced only gradually with the spread of the neolithic revolution starting at the transition
agriculture is the cultivation of animals plants fungi and other life forms for food fiber biofuel medicinal and other products used to sustain and enhance human life agriculture was the key development in the rise of sedentary human civilization whereby farming of domesticated species created food surpluses that nurtured the development of civilization the study of agriculture is known as agricultural science the history of agriculture dates back thousands of years and its development has been driven and defined by greatly different climates cultures and technologies in the civilized world industrial agriculture based on large scale monoculture farming has become the dominant agricultural methodology modern agronomy plant breeding agrochemicals such as pesticides and fertilizers and technological developments have in many cases sharply increased yields from cultivation but at the same time have caused widespread ecological damage and negative human health effects selective breeding and modern practices in animal husbandry have similarly increased the output of meat but have raised concerns about animal welfare and the health effects of the antibiotics growth hormones and other chemicals commonly used in industrial meat production genetically modified organisms are an increasing component of agriculture although they are banned in several countries agricultural food production and water management are increasingly becoming global issues that are fostering debate on a number of fronts significant degradation of land and water resources including the depletion of aquifers has been observed in recent decades and the effects of global warming on agriculture and of agriculture on global warming are still not fully understood the major agricultural products can be broadly grouped into foods fibers fuels and raw materials specific foods include cereals grains vegetables fruits oils meats and spices fibers include cotton wool hemp silk and flax raw materials include lumber and bamboo other useful materials are produced by
food energy is potential energy that animals including humans derive from their food through the process of cellular respiration cellular respiration involves either the process of joining oxygen with the molecules of food aerobic respiration or the process of reorganizing the atoms within the molecules anaerobic respiration humans and other animals need a minimum intake of food energy to sustain their metabolism and to drive their muscles foods are composed chiefly of carbohydrates fats proteins water vitamins and minerals carbohydrates fats proteins and water represent virtually all the weight of food with vitamins and minerals making up only a small percentage of the weight carbohydrates fats and proteins comprise ninety percent of the dry weight of foods organisms derive food energy from carbohydrates fats and proteins as well as from organic acids polyols and ethanol present in the diet some diet components that provide little or no food energy such as water minerals vitamins cholesterol and fibre may still be necessary to health and survival for other reasons water minerals vitamins and cholesterol are not broken down they are used by the body in the form in which they are absorbed and so cannot be used for energy fiber a type of carbohydrate cannot be completely digested by the human body ruminants can extract food energy from the respiration of cellulose because of bacteria in their rumens using the international system of units researchers measure energy in joules j or in its multiples the kilojoule kj is most often used for food related quantities an older metric system unit of energy still widely used in food related contexts is the calorie more precisely the food calorie large calorie or kilocalorie kcal or cal equal to kilojoules contrast the small calorie cal equal to of a food calorie that is often
in biology population growth is the increase in the number of individuals in a population the population growth rate is the rate at which the number of individuals in a population increases in a given time period as a fraction of the initial population global human population growth amounts to around million annually or per year the global population has grown from billion in to billion in it is expected to keep growing where estimates have put the total population at billion by mid and billion by mid the population growth rate is the rate at which the number of individuals in a population increases in a given time period expressed as a fraction of the initial population specifically population growth rate refers to the change in population over a unit time period often expressed as a percentage of the number of individuals in the population at the beginning of that period this can be written as the formula valid for a sufficiently small time interval a positive growth rate indicates that the population is increasing while a negative growth rate indicates that the population is decreasing a growth ratio of zero indicates that there were the same number of individuals at the beginning and end of the period a growth rate may be zero even when there are significant changes in the birth rates death rates immigration rates and age distribution between the two times a related measure is the net reproduction rate in the absence of migration a net reproduction rate of more than indicates that the population of females is increasing while a net reproduction rate less than one sub replacement fertility indicates that the population of females is decreasing globally the growth rate of the human population has been declining since peaking in and at per

the food industry is a complex global collective of diverse businesses that supply most of the food consumed by the world population only subsistence farmers those who survive on what they grow can be considered outside of the scope of the modern food industry the food industry includes it is challenging to find an inclusive way to cover all aspects of food production and sale the food standards agency a government body in india describes it thusly the economic research service of the usda uses the term food system to describe the same thing agriculture is the process of producing food feeding products fiber and other desired products by the cultivation of certain plants and the raising of domesticated animals livestock the practice of agriculture is also known as farming scientists inventors and others devoted to improving farming methods and implements are also said to be engaged in agriculture in people worldwide are employed in agriculture yet it only contributes to global gdp agronomy is the science and technology of producing and using plants for food fuel fibre and land reclamation agronomy encompasses work in the areas of plant genetics plant physiology meteorology and soil science agronomy is the application of a combination of sciences agronomists today are involved with many issues including producing food creating healthier food managing environmental impact of agriculture and extracting energy from plants food processing includes the methods and techniques used to transform raw ingredients into food for human consumption food processing takes clean harvested or slaughtered and butchered components and uses them to produce marketable food products there are several different ways in which food can be produced one off production this method is used when customers make an order for something to be made to their own specifications for example a wedding cake
food safety is a scientific discipline describing handling preparation and storage of food in ways that prevent foodborne illness this includes a number of routines that should be followed to avoid potentially severe health hazards in this way food safety often overlaps with food defense to prevent harm to consumers the tracks within this line of thought are safety between industry and the market and then between the market and the consumer in considering industry to market practices food safety considerations include the origins of food including the practices relating to food labeling food hygiene food additives and pesticide residues as well as policies on biotechnology and food and guidelines for the management of governmental import and export inspection and certification systems for foods in considering market to consumer practices the usual thought is that food ought to be safe in the market and the concern is safe delivery and preparation of the food for the consumer food can transmit disease from person to person as well as serve as a growth medium for bacteria that can cause food poisoning in developed countries there are intricate standards for food preparation whereas in lesser developed countries the main issue is simply the availability of adequate safe water which is usually a critical item in theory food poisoning is preventable the five key principles of food hygiene according to who are iso is a standard developed by the international organization for standardization dealing with food safety this is a general derivative of iso iso standard the iso international standard specifies the requirements for a food safety management system that involves interactive communication system management prerequisite programs haccp principles a world health organization who report concluded that about of reported food poisoning outbreaks in the who european region occur in private homes according
food security is a condition related to the supply of food and individuals access to it concerns over food security have existed throughout history there is evidence of granaries being in use over years ago with central authorities in civilizations including ancient china and ancient egypt being known to release food from storage in times of famine at the world food conference the term food security was defined with an emphasis on supply food security they said is the availability at all times of adequate world food supplies of basic foodstuffs to sustain a steady expansion of food consumption and to offset fluctuations in production and prices later definitions added demand and access issues to the definition the final report of the world food summit states that food security exists when all people at all times have physical and economic access to sufficient safe and nutritious food to meet their dietary needs and food preferences for an active and healthy life household food security exists when all members at all times have access to enough food for an active healthy life individuals who are food secure do not live in hunger or fear of starvation food insecurity on the other hand is a situation of limited or uncertain availability of nutritionally adequate and safe foods or limited or uncertain ability to acquire acceptable foods in socially acceptable ways according to the united states department of agriculture usda food security incorporates a measure of resilience to future disruption or unavailability of critical food supply due to various risk factors including droughts shipping disruptions fuel shortages economic instability and wars in the years an estimated million people were suffering from chronic hunger the food and agriculture organization of the united nations or fao identified the four pillars of food security as availability
the international association for food protection iafp founded in is a non profit association of food safety professionals based in des moines iowa the organization claims a membership of over members from nations the mission of the iafp is to provide food safety professionals worldwide with a forum to exchange information on protecting the food supply the association provides its members with an information network on scientific technical and practical developments in food safety and sanitation through its two scientific journals food protection trends and journal of food protection its educational annual meeting and interaction with other food safety professionals before it was known as the international association of dairy and milk inspectors international association of milk sanitarians and international association of milk and food sanitarians inc the name was changed in to the international association of milk food and environmental sanitarians in it received the current name in the early th century an increasing number of cities and states in the us passed policies to ensure safety of milk the laws were a response to the food industry s deception at that time there were types of alteration in milk products on the market such as water dilution or adding butter or cheaper substitutes in addition spoiled milk is danger to health infant mortality rate was lower in cities that had monitored milk production and sale the association was established in based in milwaukee wisconsin and there were members one of the members was from canada and one from australia the rest were from the us according to the association s constitution an object is to develop uniform and efficient inspection of dairy farms milk establishments milk and milk products by men who have a thorough knowledge of dairy work the object reflects the historical context when the association

nutritional anthropology is the interplay between economic systems nutritional status and food security and how changes in the former affect the latter if economic and environmental changes in a community affect access to food food security and dietary health then this interplay between culture and biology is in turn connected to broader historical and economic trends associated with globalization nutritional status affects overall health status work performance potential and the overall potential for economic development either in terms of human development or traditional western models for any given group of people most scholars construe economy as involving the production distribution and consumption of goods and services within and between societies citation needed a key concept in a broad study of economies versus a particular econometric study of commodities and stock markets is social relations for instance many economic anthropologists state that the reciprocal gift exchange competitive gift exchange and impersonal market exchange are all reflective of dominant paradigms of social relations within a given society citation needed the main forms of economy extant around most of the world today in terms of a simple production distribution consumption model are subsistence based and market economies subsistence refers to production and consumption on a small scale of the household or community while a market based economy implies a much broader scale of production distribution and consumption a market economy also entails the exchange of goods for currency versus bartering commodities or being under continuing reciprocal gift exchange obligations this is not to say that market economies do not coexist with subsistence economies and other forms but that one type usually dominates within a given society however a broad array of scholarship exists stating that market economies are rapidly increasing in importance on a global scale even in societies that have traditionally relied

the right to food and its variations is a human right protecting the right for people to feed themselves in dignity implying that sufficient food is available that people have the means to access it and that it adequately meets the individual s dietary needs the right to food protects the right of all human beings to be free from hunger food insecurity and malnutrition the right to food does not imply that governments have an obligation to hand out free food to everyone who wants it or a right to be fed however if people are deprived of access to food for reasons beyond their control for example because they are in detention in times of war or after natural disasters the right requires the government to provide food directly the right is derived from the international covenant on economic social and cultural rights which has state parties as of may states that sign the covenant agree to take steps to the maximum of their available resources to achieve progressively the full realization of the right to adequate food both nationally and internationally in a total of countries the right to food is applicable either via constitutional arrangements of various forms or via direct applicability in law of various international treaties in which the right to food is protected at the world food summit governments reaffirmed the right to food and committed themselves to half the number of hungry and malnourished from to million by however the number has increased over the past years reaching an infamous record in of more than billion undernourished people worldwide furthermore the number who suffer from hidden hunger micronutrient deficiences that may cause stunted bodily and intellectual growth in children amounts to over billion people worldwide whilst under international law states are obliged
human rights are moral principles or norms that describe certain standards of human behavior and are regularly protected as legal rights in municipal and international law they are commonly understood as inalienable fundamental rights to which a person is inherently entitled simply because she or he is a human being and which are inherent in all human beings regardless of their nation location language religion ethnic origin or any other status they are applicable everywhere and at every time in the sense of being universal and they are egalitarian in the sense of being the same for everyone they require empathy and the rule of law and impose an obligation on persons to respect the human rights of others they should not be taken away except as a result of due process based on specific circumstances for example human rights may include freedom from unlawful imprisonment torture and execution the doctrine of human rights has been highly influential within international law global and regional institutions actions by states and non governmental organizations form a basis of public policy worldwide the idea of human rights suggests that if the public discourse of peacetime global society can be said to have a common moral language it is that of human rights the strong claims made by the doctrine of human rights continue to provoke considerable skepticism and debates about the content nature and justifications of human rights to this day the precise meaning of the term right is controversial and is the subject of continued philosophical debate while there is consensus that human rights encompasses a wide variety of rights such as the right to a fair trial protection against enslavement prohibition of genocide free speech or a right to education there is disagreement about which of these particular rights should be

a staple food sometimes simply referred to as a staple is a food that is eaten routinely and in such quantities that it constitutes a dominant portion of a standard diet in a given people supplying a large fraction of the needs for energy rich materials and generally a significant proportion of the intake of other nutrients as well the staple food of a specific society may be eaten as often as every day or every meal and most people live on a diet based on just a small number of staples staple foods vary from place to place but typically they are inexpensive or readily available foods that supply one or more of the three organic macronutrients needed for survival and health carbohydrates proteins and fats typical examples of staples include tuber or root crops grains legumes and other seeds early agricultural civilizations valued the foods that they established as staples because in addition to providing necessary nutrition they generally are suitable for storage over long periods of time without decay such storable foods are the only possible staples during seasons of shortage such as dry seasons or cold temperate winters against which times harvests have been stored during seasons of plenty wider choices of foods may be available most staple plant foods are derived either from cereals such as wheat barley rye maize or rice or starchy tubers or root vegetables such as potatoes yams taro and cassava other staple foods include pulses dried legumes sago derived from the pith of the sago palm tree and fruits such as breadfruit and plantains staple foods may also contain depending on the region sorghum olive oil coconut oil and sugar e g from plantains most staples are plant materials but in some communities fishing is the primary source of nutrition

fermentation in food processing is the conversion of carbohydrates to alcohols and carbon dioxide or organic acids using yeasts bacteria or a combination thereof under anaerobic conditions fermentation usually implies that the action of microorganisms is desirable the science of fermentation is also known as zymology or zymurgy the term fermentation is sometimes used to specifically refer to the chemical conversion of sugars into ethanol a process which is used to produce alcoholic beverages such as wine beer and cider fermentation is also employed in the leavening of bread co produced by yeast activity in preservation techniques to produce lactic acid in sour foods such as sauerkraut dry sausages kimchi and yogurt and in pickling of foods with vinegar acetic acid natural fermentation precedes human history since ancient times however humans have been controlling the fermentation process the earliest evidence of an alcoholic beverage made from fruit rice and honey dates from bc in the neolithic chinese village of jiahu and winemaking dates from bc in georgia in the caucasus area seven thousand year old jars containing the remains of wine now on display at the university of pennsylvania were excavated in the zagros mountains in iran there is strong evidence that people were fermenting beverages in babylon c bc ancient egypt c bc pre hispanic mexico c bc and sudan c bc french chemist louis pasteur was the first known zymologist when in he connected yeast to fermentation pasteur originally defined fermentation as respiration without air pasteur performed careful research and concluded i am of the opinion that alcoholic fermentation never occurs without simultaneous organization development and multiplication of cells if asked in what consists the chemical act whereby the sugar is decomposed i am completely ignorant of it when studying the fermentation of sugar to alcohol by yeast
pickling is the process of preserving or expanding the lifespan of food by either anaerobic fermentation in brine or immersion in vinegar the resulting food is called a pickle or to prevent ambiguity prefaced with the adjective pickled the pickling procedure will typically affect the food s texture and flavor in east asia vinaigrette vegetable oil and vinegar is used as the pickling medium another distinguishing characteristic is a ph or lower which is sufficient to kill most bacteria pickling can preserve perishable foods for months antimicrobial herbs and spices such as mustard seed garlic cinnamon or cloves are often added if the food contains sufficient moisture a pickling brine may be produced simply by adding dry salt for example german sauerkraut and korean kimchi are produced by salting the vegetables to draw out excess water natural fermentation at room temperature by lactic acid bacteria produces the required acidity other pickles are made by placing vegetables in vinegar unlike the canning process pickling which includes fermentation does not require that the food be completely sterile before it is sealed the acidity or salinity of the solution the temperature of fermentation and the exclusion of oxygen determine which microorganisms dominate and determine the flavor of the end product when both salt concentration and temperature are low leuconostoc mesenteroides dominates producing a mix of acids alcohol and aroma compounds at higher temperatures lactobacillus plantarum dominates which produces primarily lactic acid many pickles start with leuconostoc and change to lactobacillus with higher acidity pickling began years ago using cucumbers native to india citation needed this was used as a way to preserve food for out of season use and for long journeys especially by sea salt pork and salt beef were common staples for sailors before the days of steam engines although the
baker s yeast is the common name for the strains of yeast commonly used as a leavening agent in baking bread and bakery products where it converts the fermentable sugars present in the dough into carbon dioxide and ethanol baker s yeast is of the species saccharomyces cerevisiae which is the same species but a different strain commonly used in alcoholic fermentation which is called brewer s yeast baker s yeast is also a single cell microorganism found on and around the human body the use of steamed or boiled potatoes water from potato boiling or sugar in a bread dough provides food for the growth of yeasts however too much sugar will dehydrate them yeast growth is inhibited by both salt and sugar but more so with salt than sugar fats such as butter or eggs slow down yeast growth however others say the effect of fat on dough remains unclear presenting evidence that small amounts of fat are beneficial for baked bread volume saccharomyces exiguus also known as s minor is a wild yeast found on plants fruits and grains that is occasionally used for baking however in general it is not used in a pure form but comes from being propagated in a sourdough starter it is not known when yeast was first used to bake bread the earliest definite records come from ancient egypt researchers speculate that a mixture of flour meal and water was left longer than usual on a warm day and the yeasts that occur in natural contaminants of the flour caused it to ferment before baking the resulting bread would have been lighter and tastier than the previous hard flatbreads it is generally assumed that the earliest forms of leavening were likely very similar to modern sourdough the leavening action of yeast
bread is a staple food prepared from a dough of flour and water usually by baking throughout recorded history it has been popular around the world and is one of the oldest artificial foods having been of importance since the dawn of agriculture there are many combinations and proportions of types of flour and other ingredients and also of different traditional recipes and modes of preparation of bread as a result there are wide varieties of types shapes sizes and textures of breads in various regions bread may be leavened by many different processes ranging from the use of naturally occurring microbes for example in sourdough recipes to high pressure artificial aeration methods during preparation or baking however some products are left unleavened either for preference or for traditional or religious reasons many non cereal ingredients may be included ranging from fruits and nuts to various fats commercial bread in particular commonly contains additives some of them non nutritional to improve flavor texture color shelf life or ease of manufacturing depending on local custom and convenience bread may be served in various forms at any meal of the day it also is eaten as a snack or used as an ingredient in other culinary preparations such as fried items coated in crumbs to prevent sticking or the bland main component of a bread pudding or stuffings designed to fill cavities or retain juices that otherwise might drip away partly because of its importance as a basic foodstuff bread has a social and emotional significance beyond its importance in nutrition it plays essential roles in religious rituals and secular culture its prominence in daily life is reflected in language where it appears in proverbs colloquial expressions he stole the bread from my mouth in prayer give us this day our daily
an alcoholic beverage is a drink which contains a substantial amount of the psychoactive drug ethanol informally called alcohol a depressant with potential for abuse and physical dependence drinking alcohol plays an important social role in many cultures so most countries have laws regulating their production sale and consumption some countries ban such activities entirely however alcoholic beverages are legal in most parts of the world the global alcoholic beverages industry exceeded trillion in it is one of the most widely used recreational drugs in the world in the united states of adults have drunk alcohol at some point in time have drunk in the last year and in the last month alcoholic beverages are typically divided into three classes beers wines and spirits and typically contain between and alcohol by volume discovery of late stone age jugs suggest that intentionally fermented beverages existed at least as early as the neolithic period cir bc many nonhuman animals also consume alcohol when given the opportunity and are affected in much the same way as humans although humans are the only species known to produce alcoholic beverages intentionally wine is a fermented beverage produced from grapes wine involves a longer fermentation process than beer and also a long aging process months or years resulting in an alcohol content of abv sparkling wine can be made by means of a secondary fermentation fruit wines are made from fruits such as plums cherries or apples rice wines like sake are made from rice beer is a beverage fermented from grain mash it is made from barley or a blend of several grains if the fermented mash is distilled then the beverage is a spirit beer is the most consumed alcoholic beverage in the world cider or cyder sa d r sy d r is
cheese is a food derived from milk that is produced in a wide range of flavors textures and forms by coagulation of the milk protein casein it comprises proteins and fat from milk usually the milk of cows buffalo goats or sheep during production the milk is usually acidified and adding the enzyme rennet causes coagulation the solids are separated and pressed into final form some cheeses have molds on the rind or throughout most cheeses melt at cooking temperature hundreds of types of cheese from various countries are produced their styles textures and flavors depend on the origin of the milk including the animal s diet whether they have been pasteurized the butterfat content the bacteria and mold the processing and aging herbs spices or wood smoke may be used as flavoring agents the yellow to red color of many cheeses such as red leicester is produced by adding annatto other ingredients may be added to some cheeses such as black pepper garlic chives or cranberries for a few cheeses the milk is curdled by adding acids such as vinegar or lemon juice most cheeses are acidified to a lesser degree by bacteria which turn milk sugars into lactic acid then the addition of rennet completes the curdling vegetarian alternatives to rennet are available most are produced by fermentation of the fungus mucor miehei but others have been extracted from various species of the cynara thistle family cheesemakers near a dairy region may benefit from fresher lower priced milk and lower shipping costs cheese is valued for its portability long life and high content of fat protein calcium and phosphorus cheese is more compact and has a longer shelf life than milk although how long a cheese will keep depends on the type of cheese labels on packets of
a pickled cucumber commonly known as a pickle in the united states and canada or generically as gherkins in the united kingdom is a cucumber that has been pickled in a brine vinegar or other solution and left to ferment for a period of time by either immersing the cucumbers in an acidic solution or through souring by lacto fermentation a gherkin is a variety of cucumber the west indian or burr gherkin cucumis anguria which produces a somewhat smaller fruit than the garden cucumber cucumis sativus gherkins are cooked eaten raw or used as pickles gherkins are usually picked when to cm to in in length and pickled in jars or cans with vinegar often flavoured with herbs particularly dill hence dill pickle or brine cornichons are tart french pickles made from small gherkins pickled in vinegar and tarragon they traditionally accompany p t s brined pickles are prepared using the traditional process of natural fermentation in a brine which makes them grow sour the brine concentration can vary between g litre to more than g litre of salt there is no vinegar used in the brine of naturally fermented pickled cucumbers the fermentation process is entirely dependent on the naturally occurring lactobacillus bacteria that normally cover the skin of a growing cucumber since these are routinely removed during commercial harvesting packing processes traditionally prepared pickles can only be made from freshly harvested cucumbers unless the bacteria are artificially replaced typically small cucumbers are placed in a glass or ceramic vessel or a wooden barrel together with a variety of spices among those traditionally used in many recipes are garlic horseradish whole dill stems with umbels and green seeds white mustard seeds grape oak cherry blackcurrant and bay laurel leaves dried allspice fruits and most importantly salt the container
kombucha refers to any of a variety of fermented lightly effervescent sweetened black or green tea drinks that are commonly used as functional beverages for their unsubstantiated health benefits kombucha is produced by fermenting tea using a symbiotic colony of bacteria and yeast scoby actual contributing microbial populations in scoby cultures vary but the yeast component generally includes saccharomyces a probiotic fungus and other species and the bacterial component almost always includes gluconacetobacter xylinus to oxidize yeast produced alcohols to acetic and other acids the geographic origin of kombucha is unknown and its etymology is uncertain historically kombucha has been home brewed or locally brewed but in the late s commercially bottled kombucha became available in north american retail stores it is known in chinese as ch j n japanese as k cha kinoko korean as hongchabeoseotcha and russian as chaynyy grib these names translate literally to tea fungus or tea mushroom kombucha has been claimed to cure many diseases and to have a wide range of health benefits however there is a lack of high quality evidence to support such claims there are several documented cases of serious adverse effects including fatalities related to kombucha drinking and there is the potential for contamination during home preparation since the mostly unclear benefits of kombucha drinking do not outweigh the known risks it has not been recommended for therapeutic use kombucha has been promoted with claims that it can treat a wide variety of human illnesses including aids cancer and diabetes and that it provides other beneficial effects such as stimulation of the immune system boosting the libido and reversal of gray hair however evidence of kombucha s beneficial effects in humans is lacking in particular although animal and in vitro experiments suggest that kombucha consumption may be beneficial as of
yogurt yoghurt or yoghourt jo rt or j t from turkish yo urt other spellings listed below is a food produced by bacterial fermentation of milk the bacteria used to make yogurt are known as yogurt cultures fermentation of lactose by these bacteria produces lactic acid which acts on milk protein to give yogurt its texture and characteristic tang worldwide cow s milk the protein of which is mainly casein is most commonly used to make yogurt milk from water buffalo goats ewes mares camels and yaks however is also used to produce yogurt in various parts of the world dairy yogurt is produced using a culture of lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp bulgaricus and streptococcus thermophilus bacteria in addition other lactobacilli and bifidobacteria are also sometimes added during or after culturing yogurt some countries require yogurt to contain a certain amount of colony forming units of microorganisms in western culture the milk is first heated to about c f to denature the milk proteins so that they set together rather than form curds in some places such as parts of india and bangladesh curds are a desired component and milk is boiled after heating the milk is allowed to cool to about c f the bacterial culture is added and the temperature of c is maintained for to hours to allow fermentation the word is derived from turkish yo urt and is usually related to the verb yo urmak to be curdled or coagulated to thicken or yu ur id and the suffix t the letter was traditionally rendered as gh in transliterations of turkish prior to in older turkish the letter denoted a voiced velar fricative but this sound is elided between back vowels in modern turkish in which the word is pronounced jo u t or jo u t
the taxonomy is currently under revision cyanobacteria sa no b k t ri also known as cyanophyta is a phylum of bacteria that obtain their energy through photosynthesis the name cyanobacteria comes from the color of the bacteria greek kyan s blue they are often called blue green algae but some consider that name a misnomer as cyanobacteria are prokaryotic and algae should be eukaryotic although other definitions of algae encompass prokaryotic organisms by producing gaseous oxygen as a byproduct of photosynthesis cyanobacteria are thought to have converted the early reducing atmosphere into an oxidizing one causing the rusting of the earth and causing the great oxygenation event dramatically changing the composition of life forms on earth by stimulating biodiversity and leading to the near extinction of anaerobic organisms that is oxygen intolerant symbiogenesis argues that the chloroplasts found in plants and eukaryotic algae evolved from cyanobacterial ancestors via endosymbiosis cyanobacteria are arguably the most successful group of microorganisms on earth they are the most genetically diverse they occupy a broad range of habitats across all latitudes widespread in freshwater marine and terrestrial ecosystems and they are found in the most extreme niches such as hot springs salt works and hypersaline bays photoautotrophic oxygen producing cyanobacteria created the conditions in the planet s early atmosphere that directed the evolution of aerobic metabolism and eukaryotic photosynthesis cyanobacteria fulfill vital ecological functions in the world s oceans being important contributors to global carbon and nitrogen budgets cyanobacteria can be found in almost every terrestrial and aquatic habitat oceans fresh water damp soil temporarily moistened rocks in deserts bare rock and soil and even antarctic rocks they can occur as planktonic cells or form phototrophic biofilms they are found in almost every endolithic ecosystem a few are endosymbionts in lichens plants various protists

a spice is a seed fruit root bark berry bud or vegetable substance primarily used for flavoring coloring or preserving food spices are distinguished from herbs which are parts of leafy green plants used for flavoring or as a garnish many spices have antimicrobial properties this may explain why spices are more commonly used in warmer climates which have more infectious disease and why the use of spices is prominent in meat which is particularly susceptible to spoiling a spice may have other uses including medicinal religious ritual cosmetics or perfume production or as a vegetable the spice trade developed throughout south asia and middle east in around bce with cinnamon and pepper and in east asia with herbs and pepper the egyptians used herbs for embalming and their demand for exotic herbs helped stimulate world trade the word spice comes from the old french word espice which became epice and which came from the latin root spec the noun referring to appearance sort kind species has the same root by bce medical systems based upon herbs could be found in china korea and india early uses were connected with magic medicine religion tradition and preservation archaeological excavations have uncovered clove burnt onto the floor of a kitchen dated to bce at the mesopotamian site of terqa in modern day syria the ancient indian epic ramayana mentions cloves the romans had cloves in the st century ce as pliny the elder wrote about them citation needed in the story of genesis joseph was sold into slavery by his brothers to spice merchants in the biblical poem song of solomon the male speaker compares his beloved to many forms of spices generally early egyptian chinese indian and mesopotamian sources do not refer to known spices citation needed historians believe that nutmeg
a cultivar nb is a plant or grouping of plants selected for desirable characteristics that can be maintained by propagation most cultivars have arisen in cultivation but a few are special selections from the wild popular ornamental garden plants like roses camellias daffodils rhododendrons and azaleas are cultivars produced by careful breeding and selection for flower colour and form similarly the world s agricultural food crops are almost exclusively cultivars that have been selected for characteristics such as improved yield flavour and resistance to disease very few wild plants are now used as food sources trees used in forestry are also special selections grown for their enhanced quality and yield of timber cultivars form a major part of liberty hyde bailey s broader grouping the cultigen defined as a plant whose origin or selection is primarily due to intentional human activity cultivar was coined by bailey and it is generally regarded as a portmanteau of cultivated and variety but could also be derived from cultigen and variety a cultivar is not the same as a botanical variety and there are differences in the rules for the formation and use of the names of botanical varieties and cultivars in recent times the naming of cultivars has been complicated by the use of statutory plant patents and plant breeders rights names the international union for the protection of new varieties of plants upov french union internationale pour la protection des obtentions v g tales offers legal protection of plant cultivars to people or organisations who introduce new cultivars to commerce upov requires that a cultivar be distinct uniform and stable to be distinct it must have characteristics that easily distinguish it from any other known cultivar to be uniform and stable the cultivar must retain these characteristics under repeated propagation the naming
a seed is an embryonic plant enclosed in a protective outer covering known as the seed coat it is a characteristic of spermatophytes gymnosperm and angiosperm plants and the product of the ripened ovule which occurs after fertilization and some growth within the mother plant the formation of the seed completes the process of reproduction in seed plants started with the development of flowers and pollination with the embryo developed from the zygote and the seed coat from the integuments of the ovule seeds have been an important development in the reproduction and spread of gymnosperm and angiosperm plants relative to more primitive plants such as ferns mosses and liverworts which do not have seeds and use other means to propagate themselves this can be seen by the success of seed plants both gymnosperms and angiosperms in dominating biological niches on land from forests to grasslands both in hot and cold climates the term seed also has a general meaning that antedates the above anything that can be sown e g seed potatoes seeds of corn or sunflower seeds in the case of sunflower and corn seeds what is sown is the seed enclosed in a shell or husk whereas the potato is a tuber many structures commonly referred to as seeds are actually dry fruits plants producing berries are called baccate sunflower seeds are sometimes sold commercially while still enclosed within the hard wall of the fruit which must be split open to reach the seed different groups of plants have other modifications the so called stone fruits such as the peach have a hardened fruit layer the endocarp fused to and surrounding the actual seed nuts are the one seeded hard shelled fruit of some plants with an indehiscent seed such as an acorn or hazelnut seeds are

an unsaturated fat is a fat or fatty acid in which there is at least one double bond within the fatty acid chain a fatty acid chain is monounsaturated if it contains one double bond and polyunsaturated if it contains more than one double bond where double bonds are formed hydrogen atoms are eliminated thus a saturated fat has no double bonds has the maximum number of hydrogens bonded to the carbons and therefore is saturated with hydrogen atoms in cellular metabolism unsaturated fat molecules contain somewhat less energy i e fewer calories than an equivalent amount of saturated fat the greater the degree of unsaturation in a fatty acid i e the more double bonds in the fatty acid the more vulnerable it is to lipid peroxidation rancidity antioxidants can protect unsaturated fat from lipid peroxidation double bonds may be in either a cis or a trans isomer depending on the geometry of the double bond in the cis isomer hydrogen atoms are on the same side of the double bond whereas in the trans isomer they are on opposite sides see trans fat saturated fats are popular with manufacturers of processed foods because they are less vulnerable to rancidity and are in general more solid at room temperature than unsaturated fats unsaturated chains have a lower melting point hence increasing fluidity of the cell membranes although both monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats can replace saturated fat in the diet trans unsaturated fats should be avoided replacing saturated fats with unsaturated fats helps to lower levels of total cholesterol and ldl cholesterol in the blood trans unsaturated fats are particularly risky because the double bond stereochemistry allows the fat molecules to assume a linear conformation which leads to efficient packing i e plaque formation the geometry of the cis double

in botany a fruit is the seed bearing structure in angiosperms formed from the ovary after flowering fruits are the means by which these plants disseminate seeds many of them that bear edible fruits in particular have propagated with the movements of humans and animals in a symbiotic relationship as a means for seed dispersal and nutrition respectively in fact humans and many animals have become dependent on fruits as a source of food fruits account for a substantial fraction of the world s agricultural output and some such as the apple and the pomegranate have acquired extensive cultural and symbolic meanings in common language usage fruit normally means the fleshy seed associated structures of a plant that are sweet or sour and edible in the raw state such as apples oranges grapes strawberries bananas and lemons on the other hand the botanical sense of fruit includes many structures that are not commonly called fruits such as bean pods corn kernels wheat grains and tomatoes the section of a fungus that produces spores is also called a fruiting body in the culinary sense of these words a fruit is usually any sweet tasting plant product especially those associated with seeds a vegetable is any savory or less sweet plant product and a nut is any hard oily and shelled plant product these culinary vegetables that are botanically fruit include cucurbits e g squash pumpkin and cucumber tomatoes peas beans corn eggplant and sweet pepper in addition some spices such as allspice and chilies are fruits botanically speaking in contrast rhubarb is often referred to as a fruit because it is used to make sweet desserts such as pies though only the petiole leaf stalk of the rhubarb plant is edible edible gymnosperm seeds are often given fruit names e g
in biology coevolution is the change of a biological object triggered by the change of a related object in other words when changes in at least two species genetic compositions reciprocally affect each other s evolution coevolution has occurred there is evidence for coevolution at the level of populations and species charles darwin briefly described the concept of coevolution in on the origin of species and developed it in detail in fertilisation of orchids it is likely that viruses and their hosts coevolve in various scenarios however there is little evidence of coevolution driving large scale changes in earth s history since abiotic factors such as mass extinction and expansion into ecospaces seem to guide the shifts in the abundance of major groups one proposed specific example was the evolution of high crowned teeth in grazers when grasslands spread through north america long held up as an example of coevolution we now know that these events happened independently coevolution can occur at many biological levels it can be as microscopic as correlated mutations between amino acids in a protein or as macroscopic as covarying traits between different species in an environment each party in a coevolutionary relationship exerts selective pressures on the other thereby affecting each other s evolution coevolution of different species includes the evolution of a host species and its parasites host parasite coevolution and examples of mutualism evolving through time evolution in response to abiotic factors such as climate change is not biological coevolution since climate is not alive and does not undergo biological evolution the general conclusion is that coevolution may be responsible for much of the genetic diversity seen in normal populations including blood plasma polymorphism protein polymorphism histocompatibility systems etc the parasite host relationship probably drove the prevalence of sexual reproduction over the more
excretion is the process by which waste products of metabolism and other non useful materials are eliminated from an organism in vertebrates this is primarily carried out by the lungs kidneys and skin this is in contrast with secretion where the substance may have specific tasks after leaving the cell excretion is an essential process in all forms of life in mammals urine is carried out through the urethra and that is part of the excretory system in single celled organisms waste products are discharged directly through the surface of the cell green plants produce carbon dioxide and water as respiratory products in green plants the carbon dioxide released during respiration gets utilized during photosynthesis oxygen is a by product generated during photosynthesis and exits through stomata root cell walls and other routes plants can get rid of excess water by transpiration and guttation it has been shown that the leaf acts as an excretophore and in addition to being a green plant s primary organ of photosynthesis is also used as the plant s method of excreting toxic wastes via diffusion other waste materials that are exuded by some plants resin saps latex etc are forced from the interior of the plant by hydrostatic pressures inside the plant and by absorptive forces of plant cells these latter processes do not need added energy they act passively however during the pre abscission phase the metabolic levels of a leaf are high plants also excrete some waste substances into the soil around them in animals the main excretory products are carbon dioxide ammonia in ammoniotelics urea in ureotelics uric acid in uricotelics guanine in arachnida and creatine aquatic animals usually excrete ammonia directly into the external environment as this compound has high solubility and there is ample water available for dilution

in everyday usage a vegetable is any part of a plant that is consumed by humans as food as part of a savory meal the term vegetable is somewhat arbitrary and largely defined through culinary and cultural tradition it normally excludes other food derived from plants such as fruits nuts and cereal grains but includes seeds such as pulses the original meaning of the word vegetable still used in biology was to describe all types of plant as in the terms vegetable kingdom and vegetable matter originally vegetables were collected from the wild by hunter gatherers and entered cultivation in several parts of the world probably during the period bc to bc when a new agricultural way of life developed at first plants which grew locally would have been cultivated but as time went on trade brought exotic crops from elsewhere to add to domestic types nowadays most vegetables are grown all over the world as climate permits and crops may be cultivated in protected environments in less suitable locations china is the largest producer of vegetables and global trade in agricultural products allows consumers to purchase vegetables grown in faraway countries the scale of production varies from subsistence farmers supplying the needs of their family for food to agribusinesses with vast acreages of single product crops depending on the type of vegetable concerned harvesting the crop is followed by grading storing processing and marketing vegetables can be eaten either raw or cooked and play an important role in human nutrition being mostly low in fat and carbohydrates but high in vitamins minerals and fiber many governments encourage their citizens to consume plenty of fruit and vegetables five or more portions a day often being recommended the word vegetable was first recorded in english in the early th century it
root vegetables are plant roots used as vegetables while botany distinguishes true roots such as tuberous roots and taproots from non roots such as tubers rhizomes corms and bulbs though some contain both taproot and hypocotyl tissue making it difficult to tell some types apart in ordinary agricultural and culinary use root vegetable can apply to all these types root vegetables are generally storage organs enlarged to store energy in the form of carbohydrates citation needed they differ in the concentration and the balance between sugars starches and other types of carbohydrate of particular economic importance are those with a high carbohydrate concentration in the form of starch starchy root vegetables are important staple foods particularly in tropical regions overshadowing cereals throughout much of west africa central africa citation needed and oceania where they are used directly or mashed to make fufu or poi the following list classifies root vegetables according to anatomy storage roots are very common all over the world there are more than types of storage roots categorised in bulb rhizome tubers
the potato is a starchy tuberous crop from the perennial nightshade solanum tuberosum l the word potato may refer either to the plant itself or to the edible tuber in the andes where the species is indigenous there are some other closely related cultivated potato species potatoes were introduced outside the andes region approximately four centuries ago and have since become an integral part of much of the world s food supply it is the world s fourth largest food crop following maize wheat and rice the green leaves and green skins of tubers exposed to the light are toxic wild potato species can be found throughout the americas from the united states to southern chile the potato was originally believed to have been domesticated independently in multiple locations but later genetic testing of the wide variety of cultivars and wild species proved a single origin for potatoes in the area of present day southern peru and extreme northwestern bolivia from a species in the solanum brevicaule complex where they were domesticated approximately years ago following centuries of selective breeding there are now over a thousand different types of potatoes over of the presently cultivated potatoes worldwide descended from varieties that originated in the lowlands of south central chile which have displaced formerly popular varieties from the andes however the local importance of the potato is variable and changing rapidly it remains an essential crop in europe especially eastern and central europe where per capita production is still the highest in the world but the most rapid expansion over the past few decades has occurred in southern and eastern asia as of china led the world in potato production and nearly a third of the world s potatoes were harvested in china and india the english word potato comes from

the onion allium cepa l latin cepa onion also known as the bulb onion or common onion is a vegetable and is the most widely cultivated species of the genus allium this genus also contains several other species variously referred to as onions and cultivated for food such as the japanese bunching onion a fistulosum the egyptian onion a proliferum and the canada onion a canadense the name wild onion is applied to a number of allium species but a cepa is exclusively known from cultivation its ancestral wild original form is not known although escapes from cultivation have become established in some regions the onion is most frequently a biennial or a perennial plant but is usually treated as an annual and harvested in its first growing season the onion plant has a fan of hollow bluish green leaves and the bulb at the base of the plant begins to swell when a certain day length is reached in the autumn the foliage dies down and the outer layers of the bulb become dry and brittle the crop is harvested and dried and the onions are ready for use or storage the crop is prone to attack by a number of pests and diseases particularly the onion fly the onion eelworm and various fungi cause rotting some varieties of a cepa such as shallots and potato onions produce multiple bulbs onions are cultivated and used around the world as a food item they are usually served cooked as a vegetable or part of a prepared savoury dish but can also be eaten raw or used to make pickles or chutneys they are pungent when chopped and contain certain chemical substances which irritate the eyes the onion plant allium cepa also known as the bulb onion or common onion is
leaf vegetables also called potherbs greens vegetable greens leafy greens or salad greens are plant leaves eaten as a vegetable sometimes accompanied by tender petioles and shoots although they come from a very wide variety of plants most share a great deal with other leaf vegetables in nutrition and cooking methods nearly one thousand species of plants with edible leaves are known leaf vegetables most often come from short lived herbaceous plants such as lettuce and spinach woody plants whose leaves can be eaten as leaf vegetables include adansonia aralia moringa morus and toona species the leaves of many fodder crops are also edible for humans but usually only eaten under famine conditions examples include alfalfa clover and most grasses including wheat and barley these plants are often much more prolific than more traditional leaf vegetables but exploitation of their rich nutrition is difficult primarily because of their high fiber content this obstacle can be overcome by further processing such as drying and grinding into powder or pulping and pressing for juice leaf vegetables contain many typical plant nutrients but since they are photosynthetic tissues their vitamin k levels in relation to those of other fruits and vegetables as well as other types of foods is particularly notable the reason is that phylloquinone the most common form of the vitamin is directly involved in photosynthesis this causes leaf vegetables to be the primary food class that interacts significantly with the anticoagulant pharmaceutical warfarin during the first half of the th century it was common for greengrocers to carry small bunches of herbs tied with a string to small green and red peppers these bundles were called potherbs fresh gotukola centella asiatica fresh swiss chard fresh water spinach sabzi khordan an iranian salad like dish leaf vegetables are typically low in
spinach spinacia oleracea is an edible flowering plant in the family amaranthaceae native to central and western asia it is an annual plant rarely biennial which grows up to cm tall spinach may survive over winter in temperate regions the leaves are alternate simple ovate to triangular and very variable in size from about cm long and cm broad with larger leaves at the base of the plant and small leaves higher on the flowering stem the flowers are inconspicuous yellow green mm in diameter maturing into a small hard dry lumpy fruit cluster mm across containing several seeds common spinach s oleracea was long considered to be in the family chenopodiaceae but in that family was merged into the family amaranthaceae in the order caryophyllales within the family amaranthaceae amaranthoideae and chenopodioideae are now subfamilies for the amaranths and the chenopods respectively the english word spinach dates to the late th century and is from espinache fr pinard of uncertain origin the traditional view derives it from o prov espinarc which perhaps is via catalan espinac from andalusian arabic asb n kh from arabic al sab nikh from persian asp n kh meaning purportedly green hand but the multiplicity of forms makes the theory doubtful spinach is thought to have originated in ancient persia modern iran and neighboring countries it is not known by whom or when spinach was introduced to india but the plant was subsequently introduced to ancient china where it was known as persian vegetable b s c i present the earliest available record of the spinach plant was recorded in chinese stating it was introduced into china via nepal probably in ad in ad the saracens introduced spinach to sicily the first written evidence of spinach in the mediterranean was recorded in three th century
