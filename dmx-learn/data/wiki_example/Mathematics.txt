mathematics from greek m th ma knowledge study learning is the study of topics such as quantity numbers structure space and change there is a range of views among mathematicians and philosophers as to the exact scope and definition of mathematics mathematicians seek out patterns and use them to formulate new conjectures mathematicians resolve the truth or falsity of conjectures by mathematical proof when mathematical structures are good models of real phenomena then mathematical reasoning can provide insight or predictions about nature through the use of abstraction and logic mathematics developed from counting calculation measurement and the systematic study of the shapes and motions of physical objects practical mathematics has been a human activity for as far back as written records exist the research required to solve mathematical problems can take years or even centuries of sustained inquiry rigorous arguments first appeared in greek mathematics most notably in euclid s elements since the pioneering work of giuseppe peano david hilbert and others on axiomatic systems in the late th century it has become customary to view mathematical research as establishing truth by rigorous deduction from appropriately chosen axioms and definitions mathematics developed at a relatively slow pace until the renaissance when mathematical innovations interacting with new scientific discoveries led to a rapid increase in the rate of mathematical discovery that has continued to the present day galileo galilei said the universe cannot be read until we have learned the language and become familiar with the characters in which it is written it is written in mathematical language and the letters are triangles circles and other geometrical figures without which means it is humanly impossible to comprehend a single word without these one is wandering about in a dark labyrinth carl friedrich gauss referred to mathematics as the queen of the

euclid ju kl d greek eukleid s ancient greek eu kl d s fl bc sometimes called euclid of alexandria to distinguish him from euclid of megara was a greek mathematician often referred to as the father of geometry he was active in alexandria during the reign of ptolemy i bc his elements is one of the most influential works in the history of mathematics serving as the main textbook for teaching mathematics especially geometry from the time of its publication until the late th or early th century in the elements euclid deduced the principles of what is now called euclidean geometry from a small set of axioms euclid also wrote works on perspective conic sections spherical geometry number theory and rigor euclid is the anglicized version of the greek name which means renowned glorious very few original references to euclid survive so little is known about his life the date place and circumstances of both his birth and death are unknown and may only be estimated roughly relative to other figures mentioned alongside him he is rarely mentioned by name by other greek mathematicians from archimedes onward who usually call him the author of elements the few historical references to euclid were written centuries after he lived by proclus c ad and pappus of alexandria c ad proclus introduces euclid only briefly in his commentary on the elements according to proclus euclid belonged to plato s persuasion and brought together the elements drawing on prior work by several pupils of plato particularly eudoxus of cnidus theaetetus and philip of opus proclus believes that euclid is not much younger than these and that he must have lived during the time of ptolemy i because he was mentioned by archimedes bc although the apparent citation of euclid by archimedes has
a caliper british spelling also calliper or in plurale tantum sense a pair of calipers is a device used to measure the distance between two opposite sides of an object a caliper can be as simple as a compass with inward or outward facing points the tips of the caliper are adjusted to fit across the points to be measured the caliper is then removed and the distance read by measuring between the tips with a measuring tool such as a ruler it is used in many fields such as mechanical engineering metalworking forestry woodworking science and medicine a plurale tantum sense of the word calipers coexists in natural usage with the regular noun sense of caliper that is sometimes a caliper is treated cognitively like a pair of glasses or a pair of scissors resulting in a phrase such as hand me those calipers or those calipers are mine in reference to one unit also existing colloquially but not in formal usage is referring to a vernier caliper as a vernier or a pair of verniers in imprecise colloquial usage some speakers extend this even to dial calipers although they involve no vernier scale in machine shop usage the term caliper is often used in contradistinction to micrometer even though outside micrometers are technically a form of caliper in this usage caliper implies only the form factor of the vernier or dial caliper or its digital counterpart the earliest caliper has been found in the greek giglio wreck near the italian coast the ship find dates to the th century bc the wooden piece already featured a fixed and a movable jaw although rare finds caliper remained in use by the greeks and romans a bronze caliper dating from ad was used for minute measurements during the chinese xin
raffaello sanzio da urbino italian raffa llo santsjo da ur bi no april or march april known as raphael r fe l us r fi l r fa l was an italian painter and architect of the high renaissance his work is admired for its clarity of form ease of composition and visual achievement of the neoplatonic ideal of human grandeur together with michelangelo and leonardo da vinci he forms the traditional trinity of great masters of that period raphael was enormously productive running an unusually large workshop and despite his death at leaving a large body of work many of his works are found in the vatican palace where the frescoed raphael rooms were the central and the largest work of his career the best known work is the school of athens in the vatican stanza della segnatura after his early years in rome much of his work was executed by his workshop from his drawings with considerable loss of quality he was extremely influential in his lifetime though outside rome his work was mostly known from his collaborative printmaking after his death the influence of his great rival michelangelo was more widespread until the th and th centuries when raphael s more serene and harmonious qualities were again regarded as the highest models his career falls naturally into three phases and three styles first described by giorgio vasari his early years in umbria then a period of about four years absorbing the artistic traditions of florence followed by his last hectic and triumphant twelve years in rome working for two popes and their close associates raphael was born in the small but artistically significant central italian city of urbino in the marche region where his father giovanni santi was court painter to the duke the reputation of the
the school of athens or scuola di atene in italian is one of the most famous frescoes by the italian renaissance artist raphael it was painted between and as a part of raphael s commission to decorate the rooms now known as the stanze di raffaello in the apostolic palace in the vatican the stanza della segnatura was the first of the rooms to be decorated and the school of athens representing philosophy was probably the second painting to be finished there after la disputa theology on the opposite wall and the parnassus literature the picture has long been seen as raphael s masterpiece and the perfect embodiment of the classical spirit of the renaissance the school of athens is one of a group of four main frescoes on the walls of the stanza those on either side centrally interrupted by windows that depict distinct branches of knowledge each theme is identified above by a separate tondo containing a majestic female figure seated in the clouds with putti bearing the phrases seek knowledge of causes divine inspiration knowledge of things divine disputa to each what is due accordingly the figures on the walls below exemplify philosophy poetry including music theology and law the traditional title is not raphael s the subject of the school is actually philosophy or at least ancient greek philosophy and its overhead tondo label causarum cognitio tells us what kind as it appears to echo aristotle s emphasis on wisdom as knowing why hence knowing the causes in metaphysics book i and physics book ii indeed plato and aristotle appear to be the central figures in the scene however all the philosophers depicted sought knowledge of first causes many lived before plato and aristotle and hardly a third were athenians the architecture contains roman elements but
ancient greek includes the forms of greek used in ancient greece and the ancient world from around the th century bce to the th century ce it is often roughly divided into the archaic period th to th centuries bce classical period th and th centuries bce and hellenistic period rd century bce to th century ce it is antedated in the second millennium bce by mycenaean greek the language of the hellenistic phase is known as koine common while the language from the late period onward features no considerable differences from medieval greek koine is regarded as a separate historical stage of its own although in its earlier form it closely resembled the classical prior to the koine period greek of the classic and earlier periods included several regional dialects ancient greek was the language of homer and of classical athenian historians playwrights and philosophers it has contributed many words to english vocabulary and has been a standard subject of study in educational institutions of the west since the renaissance this article primarily contains information about the epic and classical phases of the language ancient greek was a pluricentric language divided into many dialects the main dialect groups are attic and ionic aeolic arcadocypriot and doric many of them with several subdivisions some dialects are found in standardized literary forms used in literature while others are attested only in inscriptions there are also several historical forms homeric greek is a literary form of archaic greek derived primarily from ionic and aeolic used in the epic poems the iliad and odyssey and in later poems by other authors homeric greek had significant differences in grammar and pronunciation from classical attic and other classical era dialects the origins early form and development of the hellenic language family are not well understood
quantity is a property that can exist as a magnitude or multitude quantities can be compared in terms of more less or equal or by assigning a numerical value in terms of a unit of measurement quantity is among the basic classes of things along with quality substance change and relation some quantities are such by their inner nature as number while others are functioning as states properties dimensions attributes of things such as heavy and light long and short broad and narrow small and great or much and little a small quantity is sometimes referred to as a quantulum two basic divisions of quantity magnitude and multitude imply the principal distinction between continuity continuum and discontinuity under the names of multitude come what is discontinuous and discrete and divisible into indivisibles all cases of collective nouns army fleet flock government company party people chorus crowd mess and number under the names of magnitude come what is continuous and unified and divisible into divisibles all cases of non collective nouns the universe matter mass energy liquid material animal plant tree along with analyzing its nature and classification the issues of quantity involve such closely related topics as the relation of magnitudes and multitudes dimensionality equality proportion the measurements of quantities the units of measurements number and numbering systems the types of numbers and their relations to each other as numerical ratios thus quantity is a property that exists in a range of magnitudes or multitudes mass time distance heat and angular separation are among the familiar examples of quantitative properties two magnitudes of a continuous quantity stand in relation to one another as a ratio which is a real number in mathematics the concept of quantity is an ancient one extending back to the time of aristotle and earlier aristotle
a number is a mathematical object used to count measure and label the original examples are the natural numbers and so forth a notational symbol that represents a number is called a numeral in addition to their use in counting and measuring numerals are often used for labels as with telephone numbers for ordering as with serial numbers and for codes as with isbns in common usage the term number may refer to a symbol a word or a mathematical abstraction in mathematics the notion of number has been extended over the centuries to include negative numbers rational numbers such as and real numbers such as and complex numbers which extend the real numbers by including and sometimes additional objects calculations with numbers are done with arithmetical operations the most familiar being addition subtraction multiplication division and exponentiation their study or usage is called arithmetic the same term may also refer to number theory the study of the properties of the natural numbers besides their practical uses numbers have cultural significance throughout the world for example in western society the number is regarded as unlucky and a million may signify a lot though it is now regarded as pseudoscience numerology or the belief in a mystical significance of numbers permeated ancient and medieval thought numerology heavily influenced the development of greek mathematics stimulating the investigation of many problems in number theory which are still of interest today during the th century mathematicians began to develop many different abstractions which share certain properties of numbers and may be seen as extending the concept among the first were the hypercomplex numbers which consist of various extensions or modifications of the complex number system today number systems are considered important special examples of much more general categories such as rings and fields and
structure is an arrangement and organization of interrelated elements in a material object or system or the object or system so organized material structures include man made objects such as buildings and machines and natural objects such as biological organisms minerals and chemicals abstract structures include data structures in computer science and musical form types of structure include a hierarchy a cascade of one to many relationships a network featuring many to many links or a lattice featuring connections between components that are neighbors in space buildings aircraft skeletons anthills beaver dams and salt domes are all examples of load bearing structures the results of construction are divided into buildings and non building structures and make up the infrastructure of a human society built structures are broadly divided by their varying design approaches and standards into categories including building structures architectural structures civil engineering structures and mechanical structures the effects of loads on physical structures are determined through structural analysis which is one of the tasks of structural engineering the structural elements can be classified as one dimensional ropes struts beams arches two dimensional membranes plates slab shells vaults or three dimensional solid masses the latter was the main option available to early structures such as chichen itza a one dimensional element has one dimension much larger than the other two so the other dimensions can be neglected in calculations however the ratio of the smaller dimensions and the composition can determine the flexural and compressive stiffness of the element two dimensional elements with a thin third dimension have little of either but can resist biaxial traction the structure elements are combined in structural systems the majority of everyday load bearing structures are section active structures like frames which are primarily composed of one dimensional bending structures other types are
space is the boundless three dimensional extent in which objects and events have relative position and direction physical space is often conceived in three linear dimensions although modern physicists usually consider it with time to be part of a boundless four dimensional continuum known as spacetime the concept of space is considered to be of fundamental importance to an understanding of the physical universe however disagreement continues between philosophers over whether it is itself an entity a relationship between entities or part of a conceptual framework debates concerning the nature essence and the mode of existence of space date back to antiquity namely to treatises like the timaeus of plato or socrates in his reflections on what the greeks called kh ra i e space or in the physics of aristotle book iv delta in the definition of topos i e place or in the later geometrical conception of place as space qua extension in the discourse on place qawl fi al makan of the th century arab polymath alhazen many of these classical philosophical questions were discussed in the renaissance and then reformulated in the th century particularly during the early development of classical mechanics in isaac newton s view space was absolute in the sense that it existed permanently and independently of whether there was any matter in the space other natural philosophers notably gottfried leibniz thought instead that space was in fact a collection of relations between objects given by their distance and direction from one another in the th century the philosopher and theologian george berkeley attempted to refute the visibility of spatial depth in his essay towards a new theory of vision later the metaphysician immanuel kant said that neither space nor time can be empirically perceived they are elements of a systematic framework that
calculus is the mathematical study of change in the same way that geometry is the study of shape and algebra is the study of operations and their application to solving equations it has two major branches differential calculus concerning rates of change and slopes of curves and integral calculus concerning accumulation of quantities and the areas under and between curves these two branches are related to each other by the fundamental theorem of calculus both branches make use of the fundamental notions of convergence of infinite sequences and infinite series to a well defined limit generally modern calculus is considered to have been developed in the th century by isaac newton and gottfried leibniz today calculus has widespread uses in science engineering and economics and can solve many problems that algebra alone cannot calculus is a part of modern mathematics education a course in calculus is a gateway to other more advanced courses in mathematics devoted to the study of functions and limits broadly called mathematical analysis calculus has historically been called the calculus of infinitesimals or infinitesimal calculus the word calculus comes from latin calculus and refers to a small stone used for counting more generally calculus plural calculi refers to any method or system of calculation guided by the symbolic manipulation of expressions some examples of other well known calculi are propositional calculus calculus of variations lambda calculus and process calculus modern calculus was developed in th century europe by isaac newton and gottfried wilhelm leibniz but elements of it have appeared in ancient india greece china medieval europe and the middle east the ancient period introduced some of the ideas that led to integral calculus but does not seem to have developed these ideas in a rigorous and systematic way calculations of volume and area one goal
definitions of mathematics vary widely and different schools of thought particularly in philosophy have suggested radically different and controversial accounts aristotle defined mathematics as the science of quantity in aristotle s classification of the sciences discrete quantities were studied by arithmetic continuous quantities by geometry auguste comte s definition tried to explain the role of mathematics in coordinating phenomena in all other fields the science of indirect measurement auguste comte the indirectness in comte s definition refers to determining quantities that cannot be measured directly such as the distance to planets or the size of atoms by means of their relations to quantities that can be measured directly the preceding kinds of definitions which had prevailed since aristotle s time were abandoned in the th century as new branches of mathematics were developed which bore no obvious relation to measurement or the physical world such as group theory projective geometry and non euclidean geometry as mathematicians pursued greater rigor and more abstract foundations some proposed definitions purely in terms of logic mathematics is the science that draws necessary conclusions benjamin peirce all mathematics is symbolic logic bertrand russell peirce did not think that mathematics is the same as logic since he thought mathematics makes only hypothetical assertions not categorical ones russell s definition on the other hand expresses the logicist philosophy of mathematics without reservation competing philosophies of mathematics put forth different definitions opposing the completely deductive character of logicism intuitionism emphasizes the construction of ideas in the mind here is an inituitionist definition mathematics is mental activity which consists in carrying out one after the other those mental constructions which are inductive and effective meaning that by combining fundamental ideas one reaches a definite result formalism denies both physical and mental meaning to mathematics making the symbols and rules
a mathematician is someone who uses an extensive knowledge of mathematics in their work typically to solve mathematical problems mathematics is concerned with numbers data quantity structure space models and change one of the earliest known mathematicians was thales of miletus c c bc he has been hailed as the first true mathematician and the first known individual to whom a mathematical discovery has been attributed he is credited with the first use of deductive reasoning applied to geometry by deriving four corollaries to thales theorem the number of known mathematicians grew when pythagoras of samos c c bc established the pythagorean school whose doctrine it was that mathematics ruled the universe and whose motto was all is number it was the pythagoreans who coined the term mathematics and with whom the study of mathematics for its own sake begins the first woman mathematician recorded by history was hypatia of alexandria ad she succeeded her father as librarian at the great library and wrote many works on applied mathematics because of a political dispute the christian community in alexandria punished her presuming she was involved by stripping her naked and scraping off her skin with clamshells some say roofing tiles science and mathematics in the islamic world during the middle ages followed various models and modes of funding varied based primarily on scholars it was extensive patronage and strong intellectual policies implemented by specific rulers that allowed scientific knowledge to develop in many areas funding for translation of scientific texts in other languages was ongoing throughout the reign of certain caliphs and it turned out that certain scholars became experts in the works they translated and in turn received further support for continuing to develop certain sciences as these sciences received wider attention from the elite more scholars were invited
a pattern apart from the term s use to mean template a is a discernible regularity in the world or in a manmade design as such the elements of a pattern repeat in a predictable manner a geometric pattern is a kind of pattern formed of geometric shapes and typically repeating like a wallpaper any of the five senses may directly observe patterns conversely abstract patterns in science mathematics or language may be observable only by analysis direct observation in practice means seeing visual patterns which are widespread in nature and in art visual patterns in nature are often chaotic never exactly repeating and often involve fractals natural patterns include spirals meanders waves foams tilings cracks and those created by symmetries of rotation and reflection patterns have an underlying mathematical structure indeed mathematics can be seen as the search for regularities and the output of any function is a mathematical pattern similarly in the sciences theories explain and predict regularities in the world in art and architecture decorations or visual motifs may be combined and repeated to form patterns designed to have a chosen effect on the viewer in computer science a software design pattern is a known solution to a class of problems in programming in fashion the pattern is a template used to create any number of similar garments nature provides examples of many kinds of pattern including symmetries trees and other structures with a fractal dimension spirals meanders waves foams tilings cracks and stripes symmetry is widespread in living things animals that move usually have bilateral or mirror symmetry as this favours movement plants often have radial or rotational symmetry as do many flowers as well as animals which are largely static as adults such as sea anemones fivefold symmetry is found in the echinoderms including starfish
in mathematics a conjecture is a conclusion or proposition based on incomplete information but for which no proof has been found conjectures such as the riemann hypothesis still a conjecture or fermat s last theorem now proven while has been called fermat s conjecture have shaped much of mathematical history as new areas of mathematics are developed in order to solve them in number theory fermat s last theorem sometimes called fermat s conjecture especially in older texts states that no three positive integers a b and c can satisfy the equation an bn cn for any integer value of n greater than two this theorem was first conjectured by pierre de fermat in in the margin of a copy of arithmetica where he claimed he had a proof that was too large to fit in the margin the first successful proof was released in by andrew wiles and formally published in after years of effort by mathematicians the unsolved problem stimulated the development of algebraic number theory in the th century and the proof of the modularity theorem in the th century it is among the most notable theorems in the history of mathematics and prior to its proof it was in the guinness book of world records for most difficult mathematical problems in mathematics the four color theorem or the four color map theorem states that given any separation of a plane into contiguous regions producing a figure called a map no more than four colors are required to color the regions of the map so that no two adjacent regions have the same color two regions are called adjacent if they share a common boundary that is not a corner where corners are the points shared by three or more regions for example in the map of
in mathematics a proof is a deductive argument for a mathematical statement in the argument other previously established statements such as theorems can be used in principle a proof can be traced back to self evident or assumed statements known as axioms proofs are examples of deductive reasoning and are distinguished from inductive or empirical arguments a proof must demonstrate that a statement is always true occasionally by listing all possible cases and showing that it holds in each rather than enumerate many confirmatory cases an unproved proposition that is believed true is known as a conjecture proofs employ logic but usually include some amount of natural language which usually admits some ambiguity in fact the vast majority of proofs in written mathematics can be considered as applications of rigorous informal logic purely formal proofs written in symbolic language instead of natural language are considered in proof theory the distinction between formal and informal proofs has led to much examination of current and historical mathematical practice quasi empiricism in mathematics and so called folk mathematics in both senses of that term the philosophy of mathematics is concerned with the role of language and logic in proofs and mathematics as a language the word proof comes from the latin probare meaning to test related modern words are the english probe probation and probability the spanish probar to smell or taste or lesser use touch or test italian provare to try and the german probieren to try the early use of probity was in the presentation of legal evidence a person of authority such as a nobleman was said to have probity whereby the evidence was by his relative authority which outweighed empirical testimony plausibility arguments using heuristic devices such as pictures and analogies preceded strict mathematical proof it is likely that
abstraction in mathematics is the process of extracting the underlying essence of a mathematical concept removing any dependence on real world objects with which it might originally have been connected and generalizing it so that it has wider applications or matching among other abstract descriptions of equivalent phenomena two of the most highly abstract areas of modern mathematics are category theory and model theory many areas of mathematics began with the study of real world problems before the underlying rules and concepts were identified and defined as abstract structures for example geometry has its origins in the calculation of distances and areas in the real world algebra started with methods of solving problems in arithmetic abstraction is an ongoing process in mathematics and the historical development of many mathematical topics exhibits a progression from the concrete to the abstract take the historical development of geometry as an example the first steps in the abstraction of geometry were made by the ancient greeks with euclid s elements being the earliest extant documentation of the axioms of plane geometry though proclus tells of an earlier axiomatisation by hippocrates of chios in the th century descartes introduced cartesian co ordinates which allowed the development of analytic geometry further steps in abstraction were taken by lobachevsky bolyai riemann and gauss who generalised the concepts of geometry to develop non euclidean geometries later in the th century mathematicians generalised geometry even further developing such areas as geometry in n dimensions projective geometry affine geometry and finite geometry finally felix klein s erlangen program identified the underlying theme of all of these geometries defining each of them as the study of properties invariant under a given group of symmetries this level of abstraction revealed connections between geometry and abstract algebra the advantages of abstraction are one
logic from the ancient greek logike is the branch of philosophy concerned with the use and study of valid reasoning the study of logic also features prominently in mathematics and computer science logic was studied in several ancient civilizations including greece india and china in the west logic was established as a formal discipline by aristotle who gave it a fundamental place in philosophy the study of logic was part of the classical trivium which also included grammar and rhetoric logic was further extended by al farabi who categorized it into two separate groups idea and proof later avicenna revived the study of logic and developed relationship between temporalis and the implication in the east logic was developed by hindus buddhists and jains logic is often divided into three parts inductive reasoning abductive reasoning and deductive reasoning the concept of logical form is central to logic it being held that the validity of an argument is determined by its logical form not by its content traditional aristotelian syllogistic logic and modern symbolic logic are examples of formal logics however agreement on what logic is has remained elusive and although the field of universal logic has studied the common structure of logics in mossakowski et al commented that it is embarrassing that there is no widely acceptable formal definition of a logic logic is generally considered formal when it analyzes and represents the form of any valid argument type the form of an argument is displayed by representing its sentences in the formal grammar and symbolism of a logical language to make its content usable in formal inference if one considers the notion of form too philosophically loaded one could say that formalizing simply means translating english sentences into the language of logic this is called showing the logical form of
counting is the action of finding the number of elements of a finite set of objects the traditional way of counting consists of continually increasing a mental or spoken counter by a unit for every element of the set in some order while marking or displacing those elements to avoid visiting the same element more than once until no unmarked elements are left if the counter was set to one after the first object the value after visiting the final object gives the desired number of elements the related term enumeration refers to uniquely identifying the elements of a finite combinatorial set or infinite set by assigning a number to each element counting sometimes involves numbers other than one for example when counting money counting out change counting by twos or counting by fives there is archeological evidence suggesting that humans have been counting for at least years counting was primarily used by ancient cultures to keep track of social and economic data such as number of group members prey animals property or debts i e accountancy the development of counting led to the development of mathematical notation numeral systems and writing counting can occur in a variety of forms counting can be verbal that is speaking every number out loud or mentally to keep track of progress this is often used to count objects that are present already instead of counting a variety of things over time counting can also be in the form of tally marks making a mark for each number and then counting all of the marks when done tallying this is useful when counting objects over time such as the number of times something occurs during the course of a day tallying is base counting normal counting is done in base computers use base counting
a calculation is a deliberate process that transforms one or more inputs into one or more results with variable change the term is used in a variety of senses from the very definite arithmetical calculation of using an algorithm to the vague heuristics of calculating a strategy in a competition or calculating the chance of a successful relationship between two people for example multiplying by is a simple algorithmic calculation estimating the fair price for financial instruments using the black scholes model is a complex algorithmic calculation statistical estimations of the likely election results from opinion polls also involve algorithmic calculations but produces ranges of possibilities rather than exact answers to calculate means to ascertain by computing the english word derives from the latin calculus which originally meant a small stone in the gall bladder from latin calx it also meant a pebble used for calculating or a small stone used as a counter in an abacus latin abacus greek abax the abacus was an instrument used by greeks and romans for arithmetic calculations preceding the slide rule and the electronic calculator and consisted of perforated pebbles sliding on an iron bars calculate comes from the greek word or gravel in english because greeks used gravel for counting according to chris b behrens s humble opinion calculation involves numbers and the word usually connotes a simple process but computation may be done by applying specific rules with or without numbers and the word is chosen for more complex tasks unreliable source calculation is a prerequisite for computation the difference in the meaning of calculation and computation appears to originate from the late medieval period
measurement is the assignment of a number to a characteristic of an object or event which can be compared with other objects or events the scope and application of a measurement is dependent on the context and discipline in the natural sciences and engineering measurements do not apply to nominal properties of objects or events which is consistent with the guidelines of the international vocabulary of metrology published by the international bureau of weights and measures however in other fields such as statistics as well as the social and behavioral sciences measurements can have multiple levels which would include nominal ordinal interval and ratio scales measurement is a cornerstone of trade science technology and quantitative research in many disciplines historically many measurement systems existed for the varied fields of human existence to facilitate comparisons in these fields often these were achieved by local agreements between trading partners or collaborators since the th century developments progressed towards unifying widely accepted standards that resulted in the modern international system of units si this system reduces all physical measurements to a mathematical combination of seven base units the science of measurement is pursued in the field of metrology the measurement of a property may be categorized by the following criteria type magnitude unit and uncertainty citation needed they enable unambiguous comparisons between measurements the type or level of measurement is a taxonomy for the methodological character of a comparison for example two states of a property may be compared by ratio difference or ordinal preference the type is commonly not explicitly expressed but implicit in the definition of a measurement procedure the magnitude is the numerical value of the characterization usually obtained with a suitably chosen measuring instrument a unit assigns a mathematical weighting factor to the magnitude that is derived as a
a shape is the form of an object or its external boundary outline or external surface as opposed to other properties such as color texture or material composition psychologists have theorized that humans mentally break down images into simple geometric shapes called geons examples of geons include cones and spheres some simple shapes can be put into broad categories for instance polygons are classified according to their number of edges as triangles quadrilaterals pentagons etc each of these is divided into smaller categories triangles can be equilateral isosceles obtuse acute scalene etc while quadrilaterals can be rectangles rhombi trapezoids squares etc other common shapes are points lines planes and conic sections such as ellipses circles and parabolas among the most common dimensional shapes are polyhedra which are shapes with flat faces ellipsoids which are egg shaped or sphere shaped objects cylinders and cones if an object falls into one of these categories exactly or even approximately we can use it to describe the shape of the object thus we say that the shape of a manhole cover is a disk because it is approximately the same geometric object as an actual geometric disk there are several ways to compare the shapes of two objects sometimes two similar or congruent objects may be regarded as having a different shape if a reflection is required to transform one into the other for instance the letters b and d are a reflection of each other and hence they are congruent and similar but in some contexts they are not regarded as having the same shape sometimes only the outline or external boundary of the object is considered to determine its shape for instance an hollow sphere may be considered to have the same shape as a solid sphere procrustes analysis is used in
in physics motion is a change in position of an object with respect to time motion is typically described in terms of displacement distance scalar velocity acceleration time and speed motion of a body is observed by attaching a frame of reference to an observer and measuring the change in position of the body relative to that frame if the position of a body is not changing with respect to a given frame of reference the body is said to be at rest motionless immobile stationary or to have constant time invariant position an object s motion cannot change unless it is acted upon by a force as described by newton s first law momentum is a quantity which is used for measuring motion of an object an object s momentum is directly related to the object s mass and velocity and the total momentum of all objects in an isolated system one not affected by external forces does not change with time as described by the law of conservation of momentum as there is no absolute frame of reference absolute motion cannot be determined thus everything in the universe can be considered to be moving more generally motion is a concept that applies to objects bodies and matter particles to radiation radiation fields and radiation particles and to space its curvature and space time one can also speak of motion of shapes and boundaries so the term motion in general signifies a continuous change in the configuration of a physical system for example one can talk about motion of a wave or about motion of a quantum particle where the configuration consists of probabilities of occupying specific positions in physics motion is described through two sets of apparently contradictory laws of mechanics motions of all large scale and familiar
the area of study known as the history of mathematics is primarily an investigation into the origin of discoveries in mathematics and to a lesser extent an investigation into the mathematical methods and notation of the past before the modern age and the worldwide spread of knowledge written examples of new mathematical developments have come to light only in a few locales the most ancient mathematical texts available are plimpton babylonian c bc the rhind mathematical papyrus egyptian c bc and the moscow mathematical papyrus egyptian c bc all of these texts concern the so called pythagorean theorem which seems to be the most ancient and widespread mathematical development after basic arithmetic and geometry the study of mathematics as a demonstrative discipline begins in the th century bc with the pythagoreans who coined the term mathematics from the ancient greek mathema meaning subject of instruction greek mathematics greatly refined the methods especially through the introduction of deductive reasoning and mathematical rigor in proofs and expanded the subject matter of mathematics chinese mathematics made early contributions including a place value system the hindu arabic numeral system and the rules for the use of its operations in use throughout the world today likely evolved over the course of the first millennium ad in india and were transmitted to the west via islamic mathematics through the work of mu ammad ibn m s al khw rizm islamic mathematics in turn developed and expanded the mathematics known to these civilizations many greek and arabic texts on mathematics were then translated into latin which led to further development of mathematics in medieval europe from ancient times through the middle ages periods of mathematical discovery were often followed by centuries of stagnation beginning in renaissance italy in the th century new mathematical developments interacting with new
greek mathematics as that term is used in this article is the mathematics written in greek developed from the th century bc to the th century ad around the shores of the eastern mediterranean greek mathematicians lived in cities spread over the entire eastern mediterranean from italy to north africa but were united by culture and language greek mathematics of the period following alexander the great is sometimes called hellenistic mathematics the word mathematics itself derives from the ancient greek mathema meaning subject of instruction the study of mathematics for its own sake and the use of generalized mathematical theories and proofs is the key difference between greek mathematics and those of preceding civilizations the origins of greek mathematics are not easily documented the earliest advanced civilizations in the country of greece and in europe were the minoan and later mycenean civilization both of which flourished during the nd millennium bc while these civilizations possessed writing and were capable of advanced engineering including four story palaces with drainage and beehive tombs they left behind no mathematical documents though no direct evidence is available it is generally thought that the neighboring babylonian and egyptian civilizations had an influence on the younger greek tradition between bc and bc greek mathematics generally lagged behind greek literature clarification needed and there is very little known about greek mathematics from this period nearly all of which was passed down through later authors beginning in the mid th century bc historians traditionally place the beginning of greek mathematics proper to the age of thales of miletus ca bc little is known about the life and work of thales so little indeed that his date of birth and death are estimated from the eclipse of bc which probably occurred while he was in his prime despite this
euclid s elements ancient greek stoicheia is a mathematical and geometric treatise consisting of books written by the ancient greek mathematician euclid in alexandria ptolemaic egypt c bc it is a collection of definitions postulates axioms propositions theorems and constructions and mathematical proofs of the propositions the thirteen books cover euclidean geometry and the ancient greek version of elementary number theory the work also includes an algebraic system that has become known as geometric algebra which is powerful enough to solve many algebraic problems including the problem of finding the square root of a number the elements is the second oldest extant greek mathematical treatises after autolycus on the moving sphere and it is the oldest extant axiomatic deductive treatment of mathematics it has proven instrumental in the development of logic and modern science according to proclus the term element was used to describe a theorem that is all pervading and helps furnishing proofs of many other theorems the word element is in the greek language the same as letter this suggests that theorems in the elements should be seen as standing in the same relation to geometry as letters to language later commentators give a slightly different meaning to the term element emphasizing how the propositions have progressed in small steps and continued to build on previous propositions in a well defined order euclid s elements has been referred to as the most successful and influential textbook ever written being first set in type in venice in it is one of the very earliest mathematical works to be printed after the invention of the printing press and was estimated by carl benjamin boyer to be second only to the bible in the number of editions published with the number reaching well over one thousand for centuries when the quadrivium
giuseppe peano italian d u z ppe pe a no august april was an italian mathematician the author of over books and papers he was a founder of mathematical logic and set theory to which he contributed much notation the standard axiomatization of the natural numbers is named the peano axioms in his honor as part of this effort he made key contributions to the modern rigorous and systematic treatment of the method of mathematical induction he spent most of his career teaching mathematics at the university of turin peano was born and raised on a farm at spinetta a hamlet now belonging to cuneo piedmont italy he attended the liceo classico cavour in turin and enrolled at the university of turin in graduating in with high honors after which the university employed him to assist first enrico d ovidio and then angelo genocchi the chair of calculus due to genocchi s poor health peano took over the teaching of calculus course within years his first major work a textbook on calculus was published in and was credited to genocchi a few years later peano published his first book dealing with mathematical logic here the modern symbols for the union and intersection of sets appeared for the first time in peano married carola crosio the daughter of the turin based painter luigi crosio known for painting the refugium peccatorum madonna in he began teaching concurrently at the royal military academy and was promoted to professor first class in the next year the university of turin also granted him his full professorship peano s famous space filling curve appeared in as a counterexample he used it to show that a continuous curve cannot always be enclosed in an arbitrarily small region this was an early example of what came to be

foundations of mathematics is the study of the logical and philosophical basis of mathematics or in a broader sense the mathematical investigation of what underlies the philosophical theories concerning the nature of mathematics in this latter sense the distinction between foundations of mathematics and philosophy of mathematics turns out to be quite vague foundations of mathematics can be conceived citation needed as the study of the basic mathematical concepts number geometrical figure set function etc and how they form hierarchies of more complex structures and concepts especially the fundamentally important structures that form the language of mathematics formulas theories and their models giving a meaning to formulas definitions proofs algorithms etc also called metamathematical concepts with an eye to the philosophical aspects and the unity of mathematics the search for foundations of mathematics is a central question of the philosophy of mathematics the abstract nature of mathematical objects presents special philosophical challenges the foundations of mathematics as a whole does not aim to contain the foundations of every mathematical topic generally the foundations of a field of study refers to a more or less systematic analysis of its most basic or fundamental concepts its conceptual unity and its natural ordering or hierarchy of concepts which may help to connect it with the rest of human knowledge the development emergence and clarification of the foundations can come late in the history of a field and may not be viewed by everyone as its most interesting part mathematics always played a special role in scientific thought serving since ancient times as a model of truth and rigor for rational inquiry and giving tools or even a foundation for other sciences especially physics mathematics many developments towards higher abstractions in the th century brought new challenges and paradoxes urging for a deeper and
truth is most often used to mean being in accord with fact or reality or fidelity to an original or to a standard or ideal truth may also often be used in modern contexts to refer to an idea of truth to self or authenticity the commonly understood opposite of truth is falsehood which correspondingly can also take on a logical factual or ethical meaning the concept of truth is discussed and debated in several contexts including philosophy art and religion many human activities depend upon the concept where its nature as a concept is assumed rather than being a subject of discussion these include most but not all of the sciences law journalism and everyday life some philosophers view the concept of truth as basic and unable to be explained in any terms that are more easily understood than the concept of truth itself commonly truth is viewed as the correspondence of language or thought to an independent reality in what is sometimes called the correspondence theory of truth other philosophers take this common meaning to be secondary and derivative according to martin heidegger the original meaning and essence of truth in ancient greece was unconcealment or the revealing or bringing of what was previously hidden into the open as indicated by the original greek term for truth aletheia on this view the conception of truth as correctness is a later derivation from the concept s original essence a development heidegger traces to the latin term veritas pragmatists like c s pierce take truth to have some manner of essential relation to human practices for inquiring into and discovering truth with pierce himself holding that truth is what human inquiry would find out on a matter if our practice of inquiry were taken as far as it could profitably
rigour bre or rigor ame see spelling differences describes a condition of stiffness or strictness rigour frequently refers to a process of adhering absolutely to certain constraints or the practice of maintaining strict consistency with certain predefined parameters these constraints may be environmentally imposed such as the rigours of famine logically imposed such as mathematical proofs which must maintain consistent answers or socially imposed such as the process of defining ethics and law rigour comes to english through old french th c modern french rigueur meaning stiffness which itself is based on the latin rigorem nominative rigor numbness stiffness hardness firmness roughness rudeness from the verb rigere to be stiff the noun was frequently used to describe a condition of strictness or stiffness which arises from a situation or constraint either chosen or experienced passively for example the title of the book theologia moralis inter rigorem et laxitatem medi roughly translates as mediating theological morality between rigour and laxness the book details for the clergy situations in which they are obligated to follow church law exactly and in which situations they can be more forgiving yet still considered moral rigor mortis translates directly as the stiffness rigour of death mortis again describing a condition which arises from a certain constraint death intellectual rigour is a process of thought which is consistent does not contain self contradiction and takes into account the entire scope of available knowledge on the topic it actively avoids logical fallacy furthermore it requires a skeptical assessment of the available knowledge if a topic or case is dealt with in a rigorous way it means that it is dealt with in a comprehensive thorough and complete way leaving no room for inconsistencies citation needed scholarly method describes the different approaches or methods which may be taken to
deductive reasoning also deductive logic logical deduction or informally top down logic is the process of reasoning from one or more statements premises to reach a logically certain conclusion it differs from inductive reasoning or abductive reasoning deductive reasoning links premises with conclusions if all premises are true the terms are clear and the rules of deductive logic are followed then the conclusion reached is necessarily true deductive reasoning top down logic contrasts with inductive reasoning bottom up logic in the following way in deductive reasoning a conclusion is reached reductively by applying general rules that hold over the entirety of a closed domain of discourse narrowing the range under consideration until only the conclusion s is left in inductive reasoning the conclusion is reached by generalizing or extrapolating from i e there is epistemic uncertainty note however that the inductive reasoning mentioned here is not the same as induction used in mathematical proofs mathematical induction is actually a form of deductive reasoning an example of a deductive argument the first premise states that all objects classified as men have the attribute mortal the second premise states that socrates is classified as a man a member of the set men the conclusion then states that socrates must be mortal because he inherits this attribute from his classification as a man the law of detachment also known as affirming the antecedent and modus ponens is the first form of deductive reasoning a single conditional statement is made and a hypothesis p is stated the conclusion q is then deduced from the statement and the hypothesis the most basic form is listed below in deductive reasoning we can conclude q from p by using the law of detachment however if the conclusion q is given instead of the hypothesis p then there
an axiom or postulate is a premise or starting point of reasoning as classically conceived an axiom is a premise so evident as to be accepted without controversy the word comes from the greek ax ma that which is thought worthy or fit or that which commends itself as evident as used in modern logic an axiom is simply a premise or starting point for reasoning whether it is meaningful and if so what it means for an axiom or any mathematical statement to be true is a central question citation needed in the philosophy of mathematics with modern mathematicians who holding a multitude of different opinions in mathematics the term axiom is used in two related but distinguishable senses logical axioms and non logical axioms logical axioms are usually statements that are taken to be true within the system of logic they define e g a and b implies a while non logical axioms e g a b b a are actually substantive assertions about the elements of the domain of a specific mathematical theory such as arithmetic when used in the latter sense axiom postulate and assumption may be used interchangeably in general a non logical axiom is not a self evident truth but rather a formal logical expression used in deduction to build a mathematical theory as modern mathematics admits multiple equally true systems of logic precisely the same thing must be said for logical axioms they both define and are specific to the particular system of logic that is being invoked to axiomatize a system of knowledge is to show that its claims can be derived from a small well understood set of sentences the axioms there are typically multiple ways to axiomatize a given mathematical domain in both senses an axiom is any mathematical statement
a definition is a statement of the meaning of a term a word phrase or other set of symbols a definitions can be classified into two large categories intensional definitions which try to give the essence of a term and extensional definitions which list every single object that a term describes a term may have many different senses and multiple meanings and thus require multiple definitions b in mathematics a definition is used to give a precise meaning to a new term instead of describing a pre existing term definitions and axioms are the basis on which all of mathematics is constructed an intensional definition also called a connotative definition specifies the necessary and sufficient conditions for a thing being a member of a specific set any definition that attempts to set out the essence of something such as that by genus and differentia is an intensional definition an extensional definition also called a denotative definition of a concept or term specifies its extension it is a list naming every object that is a member of a specific set thus the seven deadly sins can be defined intensionally as those singled out by pope gregory i as particularly destructive of the life of grace and charity within a person thus creating the threat of eternal damnation an extensional definition would be the list of wrath greed sloth pride lust envy and gluttony in contrast while an intensional definition of prime minister might be the most senior minister of a cabinet in the executive branch of government in a parliamentary system an extensional definition is not possible since it is not known who future prime ministers will be a genus differentia definition is a type of intensional definition that takes a large category the genus and narrows it down to a
the renaissance uk r ne s ns us r n s ns is a period in europe from the th to the th century considered the bridge between the middle ages and modern history it started as a cultural movement in italy in the late medieval period and later spread to the rest of europe marking the beginning of the early modern age the renaissance s intellectual basis was humanism derived from the rediscovery of classical greek philosophy such as that of protagoras who said that man is the measure of all things this new thinking became manifest in art architecture politics science and literature early examples were the development of perspective in oil painting and the recycled knowledge of how to make concrete although the invention of metal movable type sped the dissemination of ideas from the later th century the changes of the renaissance were not uniformly experienced across europe as a cultural movement it encompassed innovative flowering of latin and vernacular literatures beginning with the th century resurgence of learning based on classical sources which contemporaries credited to petrarch the development of linear perspective and other techniques of rendering a more natural reality in painting and gradual but widespread educational reform in politics the renaissance contributed to the development of the customs and conventions of diplomacy and in science to an increased reliance on observation and inductive reasoning although the renaissance saw revolutions in many intellectual pursuits as well as social and political upheaval it is perhaps best known for its artistic developments and the contributions of such polymaths as leonardo da vinci and michelangelo who inspired the term renaissance man there is a consensus that the renaissance began in florence in the th century various theories have been proposed to account for its origins and characteristics

natural science is a branch of science concerned with the description prediction and understanding of natural phenomena based on observational and empirical evidence validity accuracy and social mechanisms ensuring quality control such as peer review and repeatability of findings are amongst the criteria and methods used for this purpose natural science can be broken into two main branches life science or biological science and physical science physical science is further broken down into branches including physics astronomy chemistry and earth science all of these branches of natural science are divided into many further specialized branches also known as fields and each of these is known as a natural science in western society s analytic tradition the empirical and especially natural sciences use tools from formal sciences such as mathematics and logic converting information about nature into measurements which can be explained as clear statements about the laws of nature the social sciences also use such methods but rely more on qualitative research so that they are sometimes called soft science whereas natural sciences insofar as emphasizing quantifiable data produced tested and confirmed through the scientific method are sometimes called hard science modern natural science succeeded more classical approaches to natural philosophy usually traced to ancient greece galileo descartes francis bacon and newton debated the benefits of using approaches which were more mathematical and more experimental in a methodical way still philosophical perspectives conjectures and presuppositions often overlooked remain requisite in natural science systematic data collection including discovery science succeed natural history which emerged in the th century by describing and classifying plants animals minerals and so on yet today natural history suggests observational descriptions aimed at popular audiences philosophers of science have suggested a number of criteria including the karl popper s controversial falsifiability criterion to help them differentiate scientific
engineering is the application of mathematics empirical evidence and scientific economic social and practical knowledge in order to invent innovate design build maintain research and improve structures machines tools systems components materials and processes the discipline of engineering is extremely broad and encompasses a range of more specialized fields of engineering each with a more specific emphasis on particular areas of applied science technology and types of application the term engineering is derived from the latin ingenium meaning cleverness and ingeniare meaning to contrive devise the american engineers council for professional development ecpd the predecessor of abet has defined engineering as the creative application of scientific principles to design or develop structures machines apparatus or manufacturing processes or works utilizing them singly or in combination or to construct or operate the same with full cognizance of their design or to forecast their behavior under specific operating conditions all as respects an intended function economics of operation or safety to life and property engineering has existed since ancient times as humans devised fundamental inventions such as the wedge lever wheel and pulley each of these inventions is essentially consistent with the modern definition of engineering the term engineering deriving from the word engineer which itself dates back to when an engine er literally one who operates an engine originally referred to a constructor of military engines in this context now obsolete an engine referred to a military machine i e a mechanical contraption used in war for example a catapult notable examples of the obsolete usage which have survived to the present day are military engineering corps e g the u s army corps of engineers the word engine itself is of even older origin ultimately deriving from the latin ingenium c meaning innate quality especially mental power hence a clever
medicine british english i m ds n american english i m d s n is the science and practice of the diagnosis treatment and prevention of disease the word medicine is derived from latin medicus meaning a physician medicine encompasses a variety of health care practices evolved to maintain and restore health by the prevention and treatment of illness contemporary medicine applies biomedical sciences biomedical research genetics and medical technology to diagnose treat and prevent injury and disease typically through pharmaceuticals or surgery but also through therapies as diverse as psychotherapy external splints and traction medical devices biologics and ionizing radiation amongst others medicine has existed for thousands of years during most of which it was an art an area of skill and knowledge frequently having connections to the religious and philosophical beliefs of local culture for example a medicine man would apply herbs and say prayers for healing or an ancient philosopher and physician would apply bloodletting according to the theories of humorism in recent centuries since the advent of science most medicine has become a combination of art and science both basic and applied under the umbrella of medical science while stitching technique for sutures is an art learned through practice the knowledge of what happens at the cellular and molecular level in the tissues being stitched arises through science prescientific forms of medicine are now known as traditional medicine and folk medicine they remain commonly used with or instead of scientific medicine and are thus called alternative medicine for example evidence on the effectiveness of acupuncture is variable and inconsistent for any condition but is generally safe when done by an appropriately trained practitioner in contrast treatments outside the bounds of safety and efficacy are termed quackery medical availability and clinical practice varies across the world due
finance is a field that deals with the study of investments which includes the dynamics of assets and liabilities over time under conditions of different degrees of uncertainty and risk finance can also be defined as the science of money management a key point in finance is the time value of money which states that purchasing power of one unit of currency can vary over time finance aims to price assets based on their risk level and their expected rate of return finance can be broken into three different sub categories public finance corporate finance and personal finance questions in personal finance revolve around personal finance may involve paying for education financing durable goods such as real estate and cars buying insurance e g health and property insurance investing and saving for retirement personal finance may also involve paying for a loan or debt obligations the six key areas of personal financial planning as suggested by the financial planning standards board are corporate finance deals with the sources of funding and the capital structure of corporations and the actions that managers take to increase the value of the firm to the shareholders as well as the tools and analysis used to allocate financial resources although it is in principle different from managerial finance which studies the financial management of all firms rather than corporations alone the main concepts in the study of corporate finance are applicable to the financial problems of all kinds of firms corporate finance generally involves balancing risk and profitability while attempting to maximize an entity s assets net incoming cash flow and the value of its stock and generically entails three primary areas of capital resource allocation in the first capital budgeting management must choose which projects if any to undertake the discipline of capital budgeting
social science is a major category of academic disciplines concerned with society and the relationships among individuals within a society it in turn has many branches each of which is considered a social science the main social sciences include economics political science human geography demography and sociology in a wider sense social science also includes some fields in the humanities such as anthropology archaeology psychology history law and linguistics the term is also sometimes used to refer specifically to the field of sociology the original science of society established in the th century positivist social scientists use methods resembling those of the natural sciences as tools for understanding society and so define science in its stricter modern sense interpretivist social scientists by contrast may use social critique or symbolic interpretation rather than constructing empirically falsifiable theories and thus treat science in its broader sense in modern academic practice researchers are often eclectic using multiple methodologies for instance by combining the quantitative and qualitative techniques the term social research has also acquired a degree of autonomy as practitioners from various disciplines share in its aims and methods the history of the social sciences begins in the age of enlightenment after which saw a revolution within natural philosophy changing the basic framework by which individuals understood what was scientific social sciences came forth from the moral philosophy of the time and was influenced by the age of revolutions such as the industrial revolution and the french revolution the social sciences developed from the sciences experimental and applied or the systematic knowledge bases or prescriptive practices relating to the social improvement of a group of interacting entities the beginnings of the social sciences in the th century are reflected in the grand encyclopedia of diderot with articles from rousseau and other pioneers the
applied mathematics is a branch of mathematics that deals with mathematical methods that find use in science engineering business computer science and industry thus applied mathematics is a combination of mathematical science and specialized knowledge the term applied mathematics also describes the professional specialty in which mathematicians work on practical problems by formulating and studying mathematical models in the past practical applications have motivated the development of mathematical theories which then became the subject of study in pure mathematics where abstract concepts are studied for their own sake the activity of applied mathematics is thus intimately connected with research in pure mathematics historically applied mathematics consisted principally of applied analysis most notably differential equations approximation theory broadly construed to include representations asymptotic methods variational methods and numerical analysis and applied probability these areas of mathematics related directly to the development of newtonian physics and in fact the distinction between mathematicians and physicists was not sharply drawn before the mid th century this history left a pedagogical legacy in the united states until the early th century subjects such as classical mechanics were often taught in applied mathematics departments at american universities rather than in physics departments and fluid mechanics may still be taught in applied mathematics departments quantitative finance is now taught in mathematics departments across universities and mathematical finance is considered a full branch of applied mathematics engineering and computer science departments have traditionally made use of applied mathematics today the term applied mathematics is used in a broader sense it includes the classical areas noted above as well as other areas that have become increasingly important in applications even fields such as number theory that are part of pure mathematics are now important in applications such as cryptography though they are not generally considered to be part of
statistics is the study of the collection analysis interpretation presentation and organization of data in applying statistics to e g a scientific industrial or societal problem it is conventional to begin with a statistical population or a statistical model process to be studied populations can be diverse topics such as all persons living in a country or every atom composing a crystal statistics deals with all aspects of data including the planning of data collection in terms of the design of surveys and experiments when census data cannot be collected statisticians collect data by developing specific experiment designs and survey samples representative sampling assures that inferences and conclusions can safely extend from the sample to the population as a whole an experimental study involves taking measurements of the system under study manipulating the system and then taking additional measurements using the same procedure to determine if the manipulation has modified the values of the measurements in contrast an observational study does not involve experimental manipulation two main statistical methodologies are used in data analysis descriptive statistics which summarizes data from a sample using indexes such as the mean or standard deviation and inferential statistics which draws conclusions from data that are subject to random variation e g observational errors sampling variation descriptive statistics are most often concerned with two sets of properties of a distribution sample or population central tendency or location seeks to characterize the distribution s central or typical value while dispersion or variability characterizes the extent to which members of the distribution depart from its center and each other inferences on mathematical statistics are made under the framework of probability theory which deals with the analysis of random phenomena a standard statistical procedure involves the test of the relationship between two statistical data sets or a data
game theory is the study of mathematical models of conflict and cooperation between intelligent rational decision makers game theory is mainly used in economics political science and psychology as well as logic computer science biology and poker texas no limit hold em originally it addressed zero sum games in which one person s gains result in losses for the other participants today game theory applies to a wide range of behavioral relations and is now an umbrella term for the science of logical decision making in humans animals and computers modern game theory began with the idea regarding the existence of mixed strategy equilibria in two person zero sum games and its proof by john von neumann von neumann s original proof used brouwer fixed point theorem on continuous mappings into compact convex sets which became a standard method in game theory and mathematical economics his paper was followed by the book theory of games and economic behavior co written with oskar morgenstern which considered cooperative games of several players the second edition of this book provided an axiomatic theory of expected utility which allowed mathematical statisticians and economists to treat decision making under uncertainty this theory was developed extensively in the s by many scholars game theory was later explicitly applied to biology in the s although similar developments go back at least as far as the s game theory has been widely recognized as an important tool in many fields with the nobel memorial prize in economic sciences going to game theorist jean tirole in eleven game theorists have now won the economics nobel prize john maynard smith was awarded the crafoord prize for his application of game theory to biology the games studied in game theory are well defined mathematical objects to be fully defined a game
broadly speaking pure mathematics is mathematics that studies entirely abstract concepts this was a recognizable category of mathematical activity from the nineteenth century onwards at variance with the trend towards meeting the needs of navigation astronomy physics economics engineering and so on another insightful view put forth is that pure mathematics is not necessarily applied mathematics it is possible to study abstract entities with respect to their intrinsic nature and not be concerned with how they manifest in the real world even though the pure and applied viewpoints are distinct philosophical positions in practice there is much overlap in the activity of pure and applied mathematicians to develop accurate models for describing the real world many applied mathematicians draw on tools and techniques that are often considered to be pure mathematics on the other hand many pure mathematicians draw on natural and social phenomena as inspiration for their abstract research ancient greek mathematicians were among the earliest to make a distinction between pure and applied mathematics plato helped to create the gap between arithmetic now called number theory and logistic now called arithmetic plato regarded logistic arithmetic as appropriate for businessmen and men of war who must learn the art of numbers or they will not know how to array their troops and arithmetic number theory as appropriate for philosophers because they have to arise out of the sea of change and lay hold of true being euclid of alexandria when asked by one of his students of what use was the study of geometry asked his slave to give the student threepence since he must make gain of what he learns the greek mathematician apollonius of perga was asked about the usefulness of some of his theorems in book iv of conics to which he proudly asserted they are
the area of study known as the history of mathematics is primarily an investigation into the origin of discoveries in mathematics and to a lesser extent an investigation into the mathematical methods and notation of the past before the modern age and the worldwide spread of knowledge written examples of new mathematical developments have come to light only in a few locales the most ancient mathematical texts available are plimpton babylonian c bc the rhind mathematical papyrus egyptian c bc and the moscow mathematical papyrus egyptian c bc all of these texts concern the so called pythagorean theorem which seems to be the most ancient and widespread mathematical development after basic arithmetic and geometry the study of mathematics as a demonstrative discipline begins in the th century bc with the pythagoreans who coined the term mathematics from the ancient greek mathema meaning subject of instruction greek mathematics greatly refined the methods especially through the introduction of deductive reasoning and mathematical rigor in proofs and expanded the subject matter of mathematics chinese mathematics made early contributions including a place value system the hindu arabic numeral system and the rules for the use of its operations in use throughout the world today likely evolved over the course of the first millennium ad in india and were transmitted to the west via islamic mathematics through the work of mu ammad ibn m s al khw rizm islamic mathematics in turn developed and expanded the mathematics known to these civilizations many greek and arabic texts on mathematics were then translated into latin which led to further development of mathematics in medieval europe from ancient times through the middle ages periods of mathematical discovery were often followed by centuries of stagnation beginning in renaissance italy in the th century new mathematical developments interacting with new

pythagoras of samos us p r s uk pa r s greek pythag ras ho s mios pythagoras the samian or simply in ionian greek c c bc was an ionian greek philosopher mathematician and has been credited as the founder of the movement called pythagoreanism most of the information about pythagoras was written down centuries after he lived so very little reliable information is known about him he was born on the island of samos and traveled visiting egypt and greece and maybe india and in bc returned to samos around bc he moved to croton in magna graecia and there established some kind of school or guild pythagoras made influential contributions to philosophy and religion in the late th century bc he is often revered as a great mathematician and scientist and is best known for the pythagorean theorem which bears his name however because legend and obfuscation cloud his work even more than that of the other pre socratic philosophers one can give only a tentative account of his teachings and some have questioned whether he contributed much to mathematics or natural philosophy many of the accomplishments credited to pythagoras may actually have been accomplishments of his colleagues and successors some accounts mention that the philosophy associated with pythagoras was related to mathematics and that numbers were important it was said that he was the first man to call himself a philosopher or lover of wisdom and pythagorean ideas exercised a marked influence on plato and through him all of western philosophy the stories which were created were eagerly sought by the neoplatonist writers who provide most of the details about pythagoras but who were uncritical concerning anything which related to the gods or which was considered divine thus many myths were created such as that apollo
in mathematics the pythagorean theorem also known as pythagoras theorem is a relation in euclidean geometry among the three sides of a right triangle it states that the square of the hypotenuse the side opposite the right angle is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides the theorem can be written as an equation relating the lengths of the sides a b and c often called the pythagorean equation where c represents the length of the hypotenuse and a and b the lengths of the triangle s other two sides although it is often argued that knowledge of the theorem predates him the theorem is named after the ancient greek mathematician pythagoras c c bc as it is he who by tradition is credited with its first recorded proof there is some evidence that babylonian mathematicians understood the formula although little of it indicates an application within a mathematical framework mesopotamian indian and chinese mathematicians all discovered the theorem independently and in some cases provided proofs for special cases the theorem has been given numerous proofs possibly the most for any mathematical theorem they are very diverse including both geometric proofs and algebraic proofs with some dating back thousands of years the theorem can be generalized in various ways including higher dimensional spaces to spaces that are not euclidean to objects that are not right triangles and indeed to objects that are not triangles at all but n dimensional solids the pythagorean theorem has attracted interest outside mathematics as a symbol of mathematical abstruseness mystique or intellectual power popular references in literature plays musicals songs stamps and cartoons abound the pythagorean theorem was known long before pythagoras but he may well have been the first to prove it in any event the proof attributed to

the maya numeral system is a vigesimal base twenty positional numeral system used by the pre columbian maya civilization the numerals are made up of three symbols zero shell shape with the plastron uppermost one a dot and five a bar for example thirteen is written as three dots in a horizontal row above two horizontal lines stacked above each other numbers after were written vertically in powers of twenty for example thirty three would be written as one dot above three dots which are in turn atop two lines the first dot represents one twenty or which is added to three dots and two bars or thirteen therefore upon reaching or another row is started or then or and so on the number would be written as one dot above one dot above four dots and a bar or the powers of twenty are numerals just as the hindu arabic numeral system uses powers of tens other than the bar and dot notation maya numerals can be illustrated by face type glyphs or pictures the face glyph for a number represents the deity associated with the number these face number glyphs were rarely used and are mostly seen on some of the most elaborate monumental carving addition and subtraction adding and subtracting numbers below using maya numerals is very simple addition is performed by combining the numeric symbols at each level if five or more dots result from the combination five dots are removed and replaced by a bar if four or more bars result four bars are removed and a dot is added to the next higher row similarly with subtraction remove the elements of the subtrahend symbol from the minuend symbol if there are not enough dots in a minuend position a bar is replaced by five
a tally or tally stick was an ancient memory aid device used to record and document numbers quantities or even messages tally sticks first appear as animal bones carved with notches in the upper paleolithic a notable example is the ishango bone historical reference is made by pliny the elder ad about the best wood to use for tallies and by marco polo who mentions the use of the tally in china tallies have been used for numerous purposes such as messaging and scheduling and especially in financial and legal transactions to the point of being currency principally there are two different kinds of tally sticks the single and the split tally a common form of the same kind of primitive counting device is seen in various kinds of prayer beads a number of anthropological artefacts have been conjectured to be tally sticks the single tally stick was an elongated piece of bone ivory wood or stone which is marked with a system of notches see tally marks the single tally stick serves predominantly mnemonic purposes related to the single tally concept are messenger sticks e g inuit tribes the knotted cords khipus or quipus as used by the inca herodotus c bc reported the use of a knotted cord by darius i of persia c bc the split tally was a technique which became common in medieval europe which was constantly short of money coins and predominantly illiterate in order to record bilateral exchange and debts a stick squared hazelwood sticks were most common was marked with a system of notches and then split lengthwise this way the two halves both record the same notches and each party to the transaction received one half of the marked stick as proof later this technique was refined in various ways and
prehistory means literally before history from the latin word for before pr and greek human prehistory is the period from the time that behaviorally and anatomically modern humans first appear until the appearance of recorded history following the invention of writing systems since both the time of settlement of modern humans and the evolution of human civilisations differ from region to region prehistory starts and ends at different moments in time depending on the region concerned sumer in mesopotamia and ancient egypt were the first civilisations to develop their own scripts and to keep historical records this took place already during the early bronze age the neighbouring civilisations of the ancient middle east were the first to follow most other civilisations reached the end of prehistory during the iron age citation needed the term prehistory can refer to the vast span of time since the beginning of the universe but more often it refers to the period since life appeared on earth or even more specifically to the time since human like beings appeared the notion of prehistory began to surface during the enlightenment in the work of antiquarians who used the word primitive to describe societies that existed before written records the first use of the word prehistory in english however occurred in the foreign quarterly review in in dividing up human prehistory historians typically use the three age system whereas scholars of pre human time periods typically use the well defined geologic record and its internationally defined stratum base within the geologic time scale the three age system is the periodization of human prehistory into three consecutive time periods named for their respective predominant tool making technologies the stone age bronze age and iron age this system emerged during the late nineteenth century in the work of british
a season is a division of the year marked by changes in weather ecology and hours of daylight seasons result from the yearly orbit of the earth around the sun and the tilt of the earth s rotational axis relative to the plane of the orbit in temperate and polar regions the seasons are marked by changes in the intensity of sunlight that reaches the earth s surface variations of which may cause animals to go into hibernation or to migrate and plants to be dormant during may june and july the northern hemisphere is exposed to more direct sunlight because the hemisphere faces the sun the same is true of the southern hemisphere in november december and january it is the tilt of the earth that causes the sun to be higher in the sky during the summer months which increases the solar flux however due to seasonal lag june july and august are the hottest months in the northern hemisphere and december january and february are the hottest months in the southern hemisphere in temperate and subpolar regions four calendar based seasons with their adjectives are generally recognized spring vernal summer estival autumn autumnal and winter hibernal in american english and canadian english fall is sometimes used as a synonym for both autumn and autumnal ecologists often use a six season model for temperate climate regions that includes pre spring prevernal and late summer serotinal as distinct seasons along with the traditional four hot regions have two or three seasons the rainy or wet or monsoon season and the dry season and in some tropical areas a cool or mild season in some parts of the world special seasons are loosely defined based on important events such as a hurricane season tornado season or a wildfire season the
babylonia was an ancient akkadian speaking semitic state and cultural region based in central southern mesopotamia present day iraq a small amorite ruled state emerged in bc which contained at this time the minor city of babylon babylon greatly expanded during the reign of hammurabi in the first half of the th century bc becoming a major capital city during the reign of hammurabi and afterwards babylonia was called m t akkad the country of akkad in akkadian it was often involved in rivalry with its older fellow akkadian state of assyria in northern mesopotamia babylonia briefly became the major power in the region after hammurabi fl c bc middle chronology or c bc short chronology created a short lived empire succeeding the earlier akkadian empire neo sumerian empire and old assyrian empire however the babylonian empire rapidly fell apart after the death of hammurabi the akkadian empire fell to the babylonian empire later on the babylonian state retained the written semitic akkadian language for official use the language of its native populace despite its amorite founders and kassite successors not being native akkadians and speaking a northwest semitic canaanite language and an unclassified language isolate it retained the sumerian language for religious use as did assyria but by the time babylon was founded this was no longer a spoken language having been wholly subsumed by akkadian the earlier akkadian and sumerian traditions played a major role in babylonian and assyrian culture and the region would remain an important cultural center even under protracted periods of outside rule the earliest mention of the city of babylon can be found in a tablet from the reign of sargon of akkad bc dating back to the rd century bc babylon was merely a religious and cultural centre at this point and neither
a tax from the latin taxo rate is a financial charge or other levy imposed upon a taxpayer an individual or legal entity by a state or the functional equivalent of a state to fund various public expenditures a failure to pay or evasion of or resistance to taxation is usually punishable by law taxes are also imposed by many administrative divisions taxes consist of direct or indirect taxes and may be paid in money or as its labour equivalent few countries impose almost no taxation at all such as the united arab emirates and saudi arabia the legal definition and the economic definition of taxes differ in that economists do not regard many transfers to governments as taxes for example some transfers to the public sector are comparable to prices examples include tuition at public universities and fees for utilities provided by local governments governments also obtain resources by creating money and coins for example by printing bills and by minting coins through voluntary gifts for example contributions to public universities and museums by imposing penalties such as traffic fines by borrowing and by confiscating wealth from the view of economists a tax is a non penal yet compulsory transfer of resources from the private to the public sector levied on a basis of predetermined criteria and without reference to specific benefit received in modern taxation systems governments levy taxes in money but in kind and corv e taxation are characteristic of traditional or pre capitalist states and their functional equivalents the method of taxation and the government expenditure of taxes raised is often highly debated by whom in politics and economics tax collection is performed by a government agency such as the canada revenue agency the internal revenue service irs in the united states or her majesty s
astronomy a natural science is the study of celestial objects such as stars galaxies planets moons asteroids comets and nebulae and processes such as supernovae explosions gamma ray bursts and cosmic microwave background radiation the physics chemistry and evolution of such objects and processes and more generally all phenomena that originate outside the atmosphere of earth a related but distinct subject physical cosmology is concerned with studying the universe as a whole astronomy is one of the oldest sciences the early civilizations in recorded history such as the babylonians greeks indians egyptians nubians iranians chinese and maya performed methodical observations of the night sky however the invention of the telescope was required before astronomy was able to develop into a modern science historically astronomy has included disciplines as diverse as astrometry celestial navigation observational astronomy and the making of calendars but professional astronomy is nowadays often considered to be synonymous with astrophysics during the th century the field of professional astronomy split into observational and theoretical branches observational astronomy is focused on acquiring data from observations of astronomical objects which is then analyzed using basic principles of physics theoretical astronomy is oriented toward the development of computer or analytical models to describe astronomical objects and phenomena the two fields complement each other with theoretical astronomy seeking to explain the observational results and observations being used to confirm theoretical results astronomy is one of the few sciences where amateurs can still play an active role especially in the discovery and observation of transient phenomena amateur astronomers have made and contributed to many important astronomical discoveries astronomy from the greek from astron star and nomia from nomos law or culture means law of the stars or culture of the stars depending on the translation astronomy should not be confused with astrology the
trade involves the transfer of the ownership of goods or services from one person or entity to another in exchange for other goods or services or for money possible synonyms of trade include commerce and financial transaction a network that allows trade is called a market the original form of trade barter saw the direct exchange of goods and services for other goods and services barter is trading things without the use of money later one side of the barter started to involve precious metals which gained symbolic as well as practical importance modern traders generally negotiate through a medium of exchange such as money as a result buying can be separated from selling or earning the invention of money and later credit paper money and non physical money greatly simplified and promoted trade trade between two traders is called bilateral trade while trade between more than two traders is called multilateral trade trade exists due to the specialization and division of labor in which most people concentrate on a small aspect of production trading for other products trade exists between regions because different regions may have a comparative advantage perceived or real in the production of some trade able commodity or because different regions size may encourage mass production as such trade at market prices between locations can benefit both locations retail trade consists of the sale of goods or merchandise from a very fixed location such as a department store boutique or kiosk online or by mail in small or individual lots for direct consumption or use by the purchaser wholesale trade is defined as the sale of goods that are sold as merchandise to retailers and or industrial commercial institutional or other professional business users or to other wholesalers and related subordinated services trade originated with human
surveying or land surveying is the technique profession and science of determining the terrestrial or three dimensional position of points and the distances and angles between them a land surveying professional is called a land surveyor these points are usually on the surface of the earth and they are often used to establish land maps and boundaries for ownership locations like building corners or the surface location of subsurface features or other purposes required by government or civil law such as property sales surveyors work with elements of geometry trigonometry regression analysis physics engineering metrology programming languages and the law they use equipment like total stations robotic total stations gps receivers retroreflectors d scanners radios handheld tablets digital levels gis and surveying software surveying has been an element in the development of the human environment since the beginning of recorded history the planning and execution of most forms of construction require it it is also used in transport communications mapping and the definition of legal boundaries for land ownership surveying is important tool for every research on earth the american congress on surveying and mapping acsm defines surveying as the science and art of making all essential measurements to determine the relative position of points or physical and cultural details above on or beneath the surface of the earth and to depict them in a usable form or to establish the position of points or details citation needed also per acsm the type of surveying known as land surveying is the detailed study or inspection as by gathering information through observations measurements in the field questionnaires or research of legal instruments and data analysis in the support of planning designing and establishing of property boundaries it involves the re establishment of cadastral surveys and land boundaries based on documents of
painting is the practice of applying paint pigment color or other medium to a surface support base the medium is commonly applied to the base with a brush but other implements such as knives sponges and airbrushes can be used in art the term painting describes both the act and the result of the action the support for paintings includes such surfaces as walls paper canvas wood glass lacquer clay leaf copper and concrete and the painting may incorporate multiple other materials including sand clay paper plaster gold leaf as well as objects the term painting is also used outside of art as a common trade among craftsmen and builders painting is a mode of creative expression and the forms are numerous drawing gesture as in gestural painting composition narration as in narrative art or abstraction as in abstract art among other aesthetic modes may serve to manifest the expressive and conceptual intention of the practitioner paintings can be naturalistic and representational as in a still life or landscape painting photographic abstract narrative symbolistic as in symbolist art emotive as in expressionism or political in nature as in artivism a portion of the history of painting in both eastern and western art is dominated by spiritual motifs and ideas examples of this kind of painting range from artwork depicting mythological figures on pottery to biblical scenes rendered on the interior walls and ceiling of the sistine chapel to scenes from the life of buddha or other images of eastern religious origin what enables painting is the perception and representation of intensity every point in space has different intensity which can be represented in painting by black and white and all the gray shades between in practice painters can articulate shapes by juxtaposing surfaces of different intensity by using just color
weaving is a method of textile production in which two distinct sets of yarns or threads are interlaced at right angles to form a fabric or cloth similar methods are knitting felting and braiding or plaiting the longitudinal threads are called the warp and the lateral threads are the weft or filling weft or woof is an old english word meaning that which is woven a the method in which these threads are inter woven affects the characteristics of the cloth cloth is usually woven on a loom a device that holds the warp threads in place while filling threads are woven through them a fabric band which meets this definition of cloth warp threads with a weft thread winding between can also be made using other methods including tablet weaving back strap or other techniques without looms the way the warp and filling threads interlace with each other is called the weave the majority of woven products are created with one of three basic weaves plain weave satin weave or twill woven cloth an be plain in one colour or a simple pattern or can be woven in decorative or artistic design in general weaving involves using a loom to interlace two sets of threads at right angles to each other the warp which runs longitudinally and the weft older woof that crosses it one warp thread is called an end and one weft thread is called a pick the warp threads are held taut and in parallel to each other typically in a loom there are many types of looms weaving can be summarized as a repetition of these three actions also called the primary motion of the loom the warp is divided into two overlapping groups or lines most often adjacent threads belonging to the opposite group
babylonian mathematics also known as assyro babylonian mathematics was any mathematics developed or practiced by the people of mesopotamia from the days of the early sumerians to the fall of babylon in bc babylonian mathematical texts are plentiful and well edited in respect of time they fall in two distinct groups one from the old babylonian period bc the other mainly seleucid from the last three or four centuries bc in respect of content there is scarcely any difference between the two groups of texts thus babylonian mathematics remained constant in character and content for nearly two millennia in contrast to the scarcity of sources in egyptian mathematics our knowledge of babylonian mathematics is derived from some clay tablets unearthed since the s written in cuneiform script tablets were inscribed while the clay was moist and baked hard in an oven or by the heat of the sun the majority of recovered clay tablets date from to bce and cover topics that include fractions algebra quadratic and cubic equations and the pythagorean theorem the babylonian tablet ybc gives an approximation to accurate to three significant sexagesimal digits seven significant decimal digits babylonian mathematics is a range of numeric and more advanced mathematical practices in the ancient near east written in cuneiform script study has historically focused on the old babylonian period in the early second millennium bc due to the wealth of data available there has been debate over the earliest appearance of babylonian mathematics with historians suggesting a range of dates between the th and rd millennia bc citation needed babylonian mathematics was primarily written on clay tablets in cuneiform script in the akkadian or sumerian languages babylonian mathematics is perhaps an unhelpful term since the earliest suggested origins date to the use of accounting devices such as bullae
elementary arithmetic is the simplified portion of arithmetic that includes the operations of addition subtraction multiplication and division it should not be confused with elementary function arithmetic elementary arithmetic starts with the natural numbers and the written symbols digits that represent them the process for combining a pair of these numbers with the four basic operations traditionally relies on memorized results for small values of numbers including the contents of a multiplication table to assist with multiplication and division elementary arithmetic also includes fractions and negative numbers which can be represented on a number line digits are the entire set of symbols used to represent numbers in a particular numeral system a single digit represents a different amount than any other digit although the symbols in the same numeral system might vary between cultures in modern usage the arabic numerals are the most common set of symbols and the most frequently used form of these digits is the western style each single digit matches the following amounts zero used in the absence of objects to be counted for example a different way of saying there are no sticks here is to say the number of sticks here is one applied to a single item for example here is one stick i two applied to a pair of items here are two sticks i i three applied to three items here are three sticks i i i four applied to four items here are four sticks i i i i five applied to five items here are five sticks i i i i i six applied to six items here are six sticks i i i i i i seven applied to seven items here are seven sticks i i i i i i i eight applied to eight items here
addition often signified by the plus symbol is one of the four basic operations of arithmetic with the others being subtraction multiplication and division the addition of two whole numbers is the total amount of those quantities combined for example in the picture on the right there is a combination of three apples and two apples together making a total of apples this observation is equivalent to the mathematical expression i e add is equal to besides counting fruits addition can also represent combining other physical objects using systematic generalizations addition can also be defined on more abstract quantities such as integers rational numbers real numbers and complex numbers and other abstract objects such as vectors and matrices in arithmetic rules for addition involving fractions and negative numbers have been devised amongst others in algebra addition is studied more abstractly addition has several important properties it is commutative meaning that order does not matter and it is associative meaning that when one adds more than two numbers the order in which addition is performed does not matter see summation repeated addition of is the same as counting addition of does not change a number addition also obeys predictable rules concerning related operations such as subtraction and multiplication performing addition is one of the simplest numerical tasks addition of very small numbers is accessible to toddlers the most basic task can be performed by infants as young as five months and even some non human animals in primary education students are taught to add numbers in the decimal system starting with single digits and progressively tackling more difficult problems mechanical aids range from the ancient abacus to the modern computer where research on the most efficient implementations of addition continues to this day addition is written using the plus sign between
subtraction is a mathematical operation that represents the operation of removing objects from a collection it is signified by the minus sign for example in the picture on the right there are apples meaning apples with taken away which is a total of apples therefore besides counting fruits subtraction can also represent combining other physical and abstract quantities using different kinds of objects including negative numbers fractions irrational numbers vectors decimals functions and matrices subtraction follows several important patterns it is anticommutative meaning that changing the order changes the sign of the answer it is not associative meaning that when one subtracts more than two numbers the order in which subtraction is performed matters subtraction of does not change a number subtraction also obeys predictable rules concerning related operations such as addition and multiplication all of these rules can be proven starting with the subtraction of integers and generalizing up through the real numbers and beyond general binary operations that continue these patterns are studied in abstract algebra performing subtraction is one of the simplest numerical tasks subtraction of very small numbers is accessible to young children in primary education students are taught to subtract numbers in the decimal system starting with single digits and progressively tackling more difficult problems subtraction is written using the minus sign between the terms that is in infix notation the result is expressed with an equals sign for example there are also situations where subtraction is understood even though no symbol appears formally the number being subtracted is known as the subtrahend while the number it is subtracted from is the minuend the result is the difference all of this terminology derives from latin subtraction is an english word derived from the latin verb subtrahere which is in turn a compound of sub from
multiplication often denoted by the cross symbol by a point or by the absence of symbol is one of the four elementary mathematical operations of arithmetic with the others being addition subtraction and division the multiplication of two whole numbers when thinking of multiplication as repeated addition is equivalent to adding as many copies of one of them multiplicand as the value of the other one multiplier for example multiplied by often written as and said as times can be calculated by adding copies of together here and are the factors and is the product one of the main properties of multiplication is the commutative property adding copies of gives the same result as adding copies of the multiplication of integers including negative numbers rational numbers fractions and real numbers is defined by a systematic generalization of this basic definition multiplication can also be visualized as counting objects arranged in a rectangle for whole numbers or as finding the area of a rectangle whose sides have given lengths the area of a rectangle does not depend on which side is measured first which illustrates the commutative property the inverse operation of the multiplication is the division for example since multiplied by equals then divided by equals multiplication by followed by division by yields the original number since the division of a number other than by itself equals multiplication is also defined for other types of numbers such as complex numbers and more abstract constructs like matrices for these more abstract constructs the order that the operands are multiplied sometimes does matter a listing of the many different kinds of products that are used in mathematics is given in the product mathematics page in arithmetics multiplication is often written using the sign between the terms that is in infix notation for
in mathematics especially in elementary arithmetic division denoted or or is an arithmetic operation specifically if b times c equals a written where b is not zero then a divided by b equals c written for instance since in the above expressions a is called the dividend b is called the divisor and c is called the quotient in the expression or a is also called the numerator and b is also called the denominator conceptually division of integers can be viewed in either of two distinct but related ways quotition and partition teaching division usually leads to the concept of fractions being introduced to school pupils unlike addition subtraction and multiplication the set of all integers is not closed under division dividing two integers may result in a remainder to complete the division of the remainder the number system is extended to include fractions or rational numbers as they are more generally called division is often shown in algebra and science by placing the dividend over the divisor with a horizontal line also called a fraction bar between them for example a divided by b is written this can be read out loud as a divided by b a by b or a over b a way to express division all on one line is to write the dividend or numerator then a slash then the divisor or denominator like this this is the usual way to specify division in most computer programming languages since it can easily be typed as a simple sequence of ascii characters some mathematical software such as gnu octave allows the operands to be written in the reverse order by using the backslash as the division operator a typographical variation halfway between these two forms uses a solidus fraction slash but elevates the dividend
numeracy is the ability to reason and to apply simple numerical concepts basic numeracy skills consist of comprehending fundamental arithmetics like addition subtraction multiplication and division for example if one can understand simple mathematical equations such as then one would be considered possessing at least basic numeric knowledge substantial aspects of numeracy also include number sense operation sense computation measurement geometry probability and statistics a numerically literate person can manage and respond to the mathematical demands of life by contrast innumeracy the lack of numeracy can have a negative impact numeracy has an influence on career professions literacy and risk perception towards health decisions low numeracy distorts risk perception towards health decisions and may negatively affect economic choices greater numeracy has been associated with reduced susceptibility to framing effects less influence of nonnumerical information such as mood states and greater sensitivity to different levels of numerical risk humans have evolved to mentally represent numbers in two major ways from observation not formal math these representations are often thought to be innate see numerical cognition to be shared across human cultures to be common to multiple species and not to be the result of individual learning or cultural transmission they are approximate representations of numerical magnitude imply that one can relatively estimate and comprehend an amount if the number is large see approximate number system for example one experiment showed children and adults arrays of many dots after briefly observinging them both groups could accurately estimate the approximate number of dots however distinguishing differences between large numbers of dots proved to be more challenging precise representations of distinct individuals demonstrate that people are more accurate in estimating amounts and distinguishing differences when the numbers are relatively small see subitizing for example in one experiment an experimenter presented an infant with two
writing is a medium of human communication that represents language and emotion through the inscription or recording of signs and symbols in most languages writing is a complement to speech or spoken language writing is not a language but a form of technology that developed as tools developed with human society within a language system writing relies on many of the same structures as speech such as vocabulary grammar and semantics with the added dependency of a system of signs or symbols the result of writing is generally called text and the recipient of text is called a reader motivations for writing include publication storytelling correspondence and diary writing has been instrumental in keeping history maintaining culture dissemination of knowledge through the media and the formation of legal systems it is also an important medium of expressing oneself by way of written words as do authors poets and the like as human societies emerged the development of writing was driven by pragmatic exigencies such as exchanging information maintaining financial accounts codifying laws and recording history around the th millennium bce the complexity of trade and administration in mesopotamia outgrew human memory and writing became a more dependable method of recording and presenting transactions in a permanent form in both ancient egypt and mesoamerica writing may have evolved through calendrics and a political necessity for recording historical and environmental events h g wells argued that writing has the ability to put agreements laws commandments on record it made the growth of states larger than the old city states possible it made a continuous historical consciousness possible the command of the priest or king and his seal could go far beyond his sight and voice and could survive his death the major writing systems methods of inscription broadly fall into four categories
a numeral system or system of numeration is a writing system for expressing numbers that is a mathematical notation for representing numbers of a given set using digits or other symbols in a consistent manner it can be seen as the context that allows the symbols to be interpreted as the binary symbol for three the decimal symbol for eleven or a symbol for other numbers in different bases the number the numeral represents is called its value ideally a numeral system will for example the usual decimal representation of whole numbers gives every non zero whole number a unique representation as a finite sequence of digits beginning by a non zero digit however when decimal representation is used for the rational or real numbers such numbers in general have an infinite number of representations for example can also be written as etc all of which have the same meaning except for some scientific and other contexts where greater precision is implied by a larger number of figures shown numeral systems are sometimes called number systems but that name is ambiguous as it could refer to different systems of numbers such as the system of real numbers the system of complex numbers the system of p adic numbers etc such systems are however not the topic of this article the most commonly used system of numerals is the hindu arabic numeral system two indian mathematicians are credited with developing it aryabhata of kusumapura developed the place value notation in the th century and a century later brahmagupta introduced the symbol for zero the numeral system and the zero concept developed by the hindus in india slowly spread to other surrounding countries due to their commercial and military activities with india the arabs adopted and modified it even today the arabs
ancient egypt was a civilization of ancient northeastern africa concentrated along the lower reaches of the nile river in what is now the modern country of egypt it is one of six civilizations globally to arise independently egyptian civilization coalesced around bc according to conventional egyptian chronology with the political unification of upper and lower egypt under the first pharaoh the history of ancient egypt occurred in a series of stable kingdoms separated by periods of relative instability known as intermediate periods the old kingdom of the early bronze age the middle kingdom of the middle bronze age and the new kingdom of the late bronze age egypt reached the pinnacle of its power during the new kingdom in the ramesside period where it rivalled the hittite empire assyrian empire and mitanni empire after which it entered a period of slow decline egypt was invaded or conquered by a succession of foreign powers such as the canaanites hyksos libyans the nubians the assyrians babylonians the achaemenid persians and the macedonians in the third intermediate period and the late period of egypt in the aftermath of alexander the great s death one of his generals ptolemy soter established himself as the new ruler of egypt this greek ptolemaic kingdom ruled egypt until bc when under cleopatra it fell to the roman empire and became a roman province the success of ancient egyptian civilization came partly from its ability to adapt to the conditions of the nile river valley for agriculture the predictable flooding and controlled irrigation of the fertile valley produced surplus crops which supported a more dense population and social development and culture with resources to spare the administration sponsored mineral exploitation of the valley and surrounding desert regions the early development of an independent writing system the organization of
the middle kingdom of egypt also known as the period of reunification is the period in the history of ancient egypt between about bc and bc stretching from the establishment of the eleventh dynasty to the end of the twelfth dynasty although some writers include the thirteenth and fourteenth dynasties in the second intermediate period during this period osiris became the most important deity in popular religion the period comprises two phases the th dynasty which ruled from thebes and the th dynasty onwards which was centered on el lisht these two dynasties were originally considered to be the full extent of this unified kingdom but historians now consider the th dynasty to at least partially belong to the middle kingdom after the collapse of the old kingdom egypt entered a period of weak pharaonic power and decentralization called the first intermediate period towards the end of this period two rival dynasties known in egyptology as the tenth and eleventh fought for power over the entire country the theban th dynasty only ruled southern egypt from the first cataract to the tenth nome of upper egypt to the north lower egypt was ruled by the rival th dynasty from herakleopolis the struggle was to be concluded by mentuhotep ii who ascended the theban throne in b c during mentuhotep ii s fourteenth regnal year he took advantage of a revolt in the thinite nome to launch an attack on herakleopolis which met little resistance after toppling the last rulers of the th dynasty mentuhotep began consolidating his power over all egypt a process which he finished by his th regnal year for this reason mentuhotep ii is regarded as the founder of the middle kingdom mentuhotep ii commanded military campaigns south as far as the second cataract in nubia which

science nb is a systematic enterprise that creates builds and organizes knowledge in the form of testable explanations and predictions about the universe nb contemporary science is typically subdivided into the natural sciences which study the material world the social sciences which study people and societies and the formal sciences like mathematics the formal sciences are often excluded as they do not depend on empirical observations disciplines which use science like engineering and medicine may also be considered to be applied sciences from classical antiquity through the th century science as a type of knowledge was more closely linked to philosophy than it is now and in fact in the west the term natural philosophy encompassed fields of study that are today associated with science such as physics astronomy medicine among many others nb in the th and th centuries scientists increasingly sought to formulate knowledge in terms of laws of nature over the course of the th century the word science became increasingly associated with the scientific method itself as a disciplined way to study the natural world it was in the th century that modern scientific disciplines such as physics chemistry and biology reached their modern shapes the same time period also included the origin of the terms scientist and scientific community the founding of scientific institutions and increasing significance of the interactions with society and other aspects of culture science in a broad sense existed before the modern era and in many historical civilizations nb modern science is distinct in its approach and successful in its results modern science now defines what science is in the strictest sense of the term science in its original sense is a word for a type of knowledge rather than a specialized word for the pursuit of such knowledge in particular

mathematical reviews is a journal and online bibliographic database published by the american mathematical society ams that contains brief synopses and occasionally evaluations of many articles in mathematics statistics and theoretical computer science the journal was founded by otto e neugebauer in as an alternative to the german journal zentralblatt f r mathematik which neugebauer had also founded a decade earlier but which under the nazis had begun censoring reviews by and of jewish mathematicians the goal of the new journal was to give reviews of every mathematical research publication as of november the mathematical reviews database contained information on over million articles the authors of reviews are volunteers usually chosen by the editors because of some expertise in the area of the article it and zentralblatt f r mathematik are the only comprehensive resources of this type the mathematics section of referativny zhurnal is available only in russian and is smaller in scale and difficult to access often reviews give detailed summaries of the contents of the paper sometimes with critical comments by the reviewer and references to related work however reviewers are not encouraged to criticize the paper because the author does not have an opportunity to respond the author s summary may be quoted when it is not possible to give an independent review or when the summary is deemed adequate by the reviewer or the editors only bibliographic information may be given when a work is in an unusual language when it is a brief paper in a conference volume or when it is outside of the primary scope of the reviews originally the reviews were written in several languages but later an english only policy was introduced selected reviews called featured reviews were also published as a book by the ams but this program has
in mathematics a theorem is a statement that has been proven on the basis of previously established statements such as other theorems and generally accepted statements such as axioms the proof of a mathematical theorem is a logical argument for the theorem statement given in accord with the rules of a deductive system the proof of a theorem is often interpreted as justification of the truth of the theorem statement in light of the requirement that theorems be proved the concept of a theorem is fundamentally deductive in contrast to the notion of a scientific theory which is empirical many mathematical theorems are conditional statements in this case the proof deduces the conclusion from conditions called hypotheses or premises in light of the interpretation of proof as justification of truth the conclusion is often viewed as a necessary consequence of the hypotheses namely that the conclusion is true in case the hypotheses are true without any further assumptions however the conditional could be interpreted differently in certain deductive systems depending on the meanings assigned to the derivation rules and the conditional symbol although they can be written in a completely symbolic form for example within the propositional calculus theorems are often expressed in a natural language such as english the same is true of proofs which are often expressed as logically organized and clearly worded informal arguments intended to convince readers of the truth of the statement of the theorem beyond any doubt and from which a formal symbolic proof can in principle be constructed such arguments are typically easier to check than purely symbolic ones indeed many mathematicians would express a preference for a proof that not only demonstrates the validity of a theorem but also explains in some way why it is obviously true in some cases a

metaphysics is a traditional branch of philosophy concerned with explaining the fundamental nature of being and the world that encompasses it although the term is not easily defined traditionally metaphysics attempts to answer two basic questions in the broadest possible terms a person who studies metaphysics is called a metaphysicist or a metaphysician the metaphysicist attempts to clarify the fundamental notions by which people understand the world e g existence objects and their properties space and time cause and effect and possibility a central branch of metaphysics is ontology the investigation into the basic categories of being and how they relate to each other another central branch of metaphysics is cosmology the study of the origin fundamental structure nature and dynamics of the universe some include epistemology as another central focus of metaphysics but others question this prior to the modern history of science scientific questions were addressed as a part of metaphysics known as natural philosophy originally the term science latin scientia simply meant knowledge the scientific method however transformed natural philosophy into an empirical activity deriving from experiment unlike the rest of philosophy by the end of the th century it had begun to be called science to distinguish it from philosophy thereafter metaphysics denoted philosophical enquiry of a non empirical character into the nature of existence some philosophers of science such as the neo positivists say that natural science rejects the study of metaphysics while other philosophers of science strongly disagree the word metaphysics derives from the greek words met beyond upon or after and physik physics it was first used as the title for several of aristotle s works because they were usually anthologized after the works on physics in complete editions the prefix meta after indicates that these works come after the chapters on physics
definitions of mathematics vary widely and different schools of thought particularly in philosophy have suggested radically different and controversial accounts aristotle defined mathematics as the science of quantity in aristotle s classification of the sciences discrete quantities were studied by arithmetic continuous quantities by geometry auguste comte s definition tried to explain the role of mathematics in coordinating phenomena in all other fields the science of indirect measurement auguste comte the indirectness in comte s definition refers to determining quantities that cannot be measured directly such as the distance to planets or the size of atoms by means of their relations to quantities that can be measured directly the preceding kinds of definitions which had prevailed since aristotle s time were abandoned in the th century as new branches of mathematics were developed which bore no obvious relation to measurement or the physical world such as group theory projective geometry and non euclidean geometry as mathematicians pursued greater rigor and more abstract foundations some proposed definitions purely in terms of logic mathematics is the science that draws necessary conclusions benjamin peirce all mathematics is symbolic logic bertrand russell peirce did not think that mathematics is the same as logic since he thought mathematics makes only hypothetical assertions not categorical ones russell s definition on the other hand expresses the logicist philosophy of mathematics without reservation competing philosophies of mathematics put forth different definitions opposing the completely deductive character of logicism intuitionism emphasizes the construction of ideas in the mind here is an inituitionist definition mathematics is mental activity which consists in carrying out one after the other those mental constructions which are inductive and effective meaning that by combining fundamental ideas one reaches a definite result formalism denies both physical and mental meaning to mathematics making the symbols and rules

in mathematics and abstract algebra group theory studies the algebraic structures known as groups the concept of a group is central to abstract algebra other well known algebraic structures such as rings fields and vector spaces can all be seen as groups endowed with additional operations and axioms groups recur throughout mathematics and the methods of group theory have influenced many parts of algebra linear algebraic groups and lie groups are two branches of group theory that have experienced advances and have become subject areas in their own right various physical systems such as crystals and the hydrogen atom may be modelled by symmetry groups thus group theory and the closely related representation theory have many important applications in physics chemistry and materials science group theory is also central to public key cryptography one of the most important mathematical achievements of the th century was the collaborative effort taking up more than journal pages and mostly published between and that culminated in a complete classification of finite simple groups the range of groups being considered has gradually expanded from finite permutation groups and special examples of matrix groups to abstract groups that may be specified through a presentation by generators and relations the first class of groups to undergo a systematic study was permutation groups given any set x and a collection g of bijections of x into itself known as permutations that is closed under compositions and inverses g is a group acting on x if x consists of n elements and g consists of all permutations g is the symmetric group sn in general any permutation group g is a subgroup of the symmetric group of x an early construction due to cayley exhibited any group as a permutation group acting on itself x g by means of
projective geometry is a topic of mathematics it is the study of geometric properties that are invariant with respect to projective transformations this means that compared to elementary geometry projective geometry has a different setting projective space and a selective set of basic geometric concepts the basic intuitions are that projective space has more points than euclidean space for a given dimension and that geometric transformations are permitted that transform the extra points called points at infinity to euclidean points and vice versa properties meaningful for projective geometry are respected by this new idea of transformation which is more radical in its effects than expressible by a transformation matrix and translations the affine transformations the first issue for geometers is what kind of geometry is adequate for a novel situation it is not possible to refer to angles in projective geometry as it is in euclidean geometry because angle is an example of a concept not invariant with respect to projective transformations as is seen in perspective drawing one source for projective geometry was indeed the theory of perspective another difference from elementary geometry is the way in which parallel lines can be said to meet in a point at infinity once the concept is translated into projective geometry s terms again this notion has an intuitive basis such as railway tracks meeting at the horizon in a perspective drawing see projective plane for the basics of projective geometry in two dimensions while the ideas were available earlier projective geometry was mainly a development of the th century this included the theory of complex projective space the coordinates used homogeneous coordinates being complex numbers several major types of more abstract mathematics including invariant theory the italian school of algebraic geometry and felix klein s erlangen programme resulting in the study
logicism is one of the schools of thought in the philosophy of mathematics putting forth the theory that mathematics is an extension of logic and therefore some or all mathematics is reducible to logic bertrand russell and alfred north whitehead championed this theory created by mathematicians richard dedekind and gottlob frege dedekind s path to logicism had a turning point when he was able to reduce the theory of real numbers to the rational number system by means of set theory this and related ideas convinced him that arithmetic algebra and analysis were reducible to the natural numbers plus a logic of sets furthermore by he had concluded that the naturals themselves were reducible to sets and mappings it is likely that other logicists most importantly frege were also guided by the new theories of the real numbers published in the year this started a period of expansion of logicism with dedekind and frege as its main exponents which however was brought to a deep crisis with the discovery of the classical paradoxes of set theory cantor zermelo and russell frege gave up on the project after russell recognized and communicated his paradox exposing an inconsistency in naive set theory on the other hand russell wrote the principles of mathematics in using the paradox and developments of giuseppe peano s school of geometry since he treated the subject of primitive notions in geometry and set theory this text is a watershed in the development of logicism evidence of the assertion of logicism was collected by russell and whitehead in their principia mathematica today the bulk of modern mathematics is believed to be reducible to a logical foundation using the axioms of zermelo fraenkel set theory or one of its extensions such as zfc which has no known inconsistencies although it
in the philosophy of mathematics intuitionism or neointuitionism opposed to preintuitionism is an approach where mathematics is considered to be purely the result of the constructive mental activity of humans rather than the discovery of fundamental principles claimed to exist in an objective reality that is logic and mathematics are not considered analytic activities wherein deep properties of objective reality are revealed and applied but are instead considered the application of internally consistent methods used to realize more complex mental constructs regardless of their possible independent existence in an objective reality the fundamental distinguishing characteristic of intuitionism is its interpretation of what it means for a mathematical statement to be true in brouwer s original intuitionism the truth of a mathematical statement is a subjective claim a mathematical statement corresponds to a mental construction and a mathematician can assert the truth of a statement only by verifying the validity of that construction by intuition the vagueness of the intuitionistic notion of truth often leads to misinterpretations about its meaning kleene formally defined intuitionistic truth from a realist position yet brouwer would likely reject this formalization as meaningless given his rejection of the realist platonist position intuitionistic truth therefore remains somewhat ill defined however because the intuitionistic notion of truth is more restrictive than that of classical mathematics the intuitionist must reject some assumptions of classical logic to ensure that everything he proves is in fact intuitionistically true this gives rise to intuitionistic logic to an intuitionist the claim that an object with certain properties exists is a claim that an object with those properties can be constructed any mathematical object is considered to be a product of a construction of a mind and therefore the existence of an object is equivalent to the possibility of its construction this contrasts with
