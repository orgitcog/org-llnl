military history is a humanities discipline within the scope of general historical recording of armed conflict in the history of humanity and its impact on the societies their cultures economies and changing intra and international relationships professional historians normally focus on military affairs that had a major impact on the societies involved as well as the aftermath of conflicts while amateur historians and hobbyists often take a larger interest in the details of battles equipment and uniforms in use the essential subjects of military history study are the causes of war the social and cultural foundations military doctrine on each side the logistics leadership technology strategy and tactics used and how these changed over time on the other hand just war theory explores the moral dimensions of warfare and to better limit the destructive reality caused by war seeks to establish a doctrine of military ethics as an applied field military history has been studied at academies and service schools because the military command seeks to not repeat past mistakes and improve upon its current performance by instilling an ability in commanders to perceive historical parallels during a battle so as to capitalize on the lessons learned from the past the discipline of military history is dynamic changing with development as much of the subject area as the societies and organisations that make use of it the dynamic nature of the discipline of military history is largely related to the rapidity of change the military forces and the art and science of managing them as well as the frenetic pace of technological development that had taken place during the period known as the industrial revolution and more recently in the nuclear and information ages an important recent concept is the revolution in military affairs rma which attempts to explain how
prehistoric warfare refers to war conducted by stateless societies before recorded history the existence and even definition of war in humanity s hypothetical state of nature has been a controversial topic in the history of ideas at least since thomas hobbes in leviathan argued a war of all against all a view directly challenged by jean jacques rousseau in a discourse on inequality and the social contract the debate over human nature continues spanning contemporary anthropology archaeology ethnography history political science cognitive psychology primatology and philosophy in such divergent books as azar gat s war in human civilization and raymond c kelly s warless societies and the origin of war for the purposes of this article prehistoric war will be broadly defined as a state of organized lethal aggression between autonomous preliterate communities according to cultural anthropologist and ethnographer raymond c kelly the earliest hunter gatherer societies of homo erectus population density was probably low enough to avoid armed conflict the development of the throwing spear together with ambush hunting techniques made potential violence between hunting parties very costly dictating cooperation and maintenance of low population densities to prevent competition for resources this behavior may have accelerated the migration out of africa of h erectus some million years ago as a natural consequence of conflict avoidance this period of paleolithic warlessness persisted until well after the appearance of homo sapiens some million years ago ending only at the occurrence of economic and social shifts associated with sedentism when new conditions incentivized organized raiding of settlements of the many cave paintings of the upper paleolithic none depict people attacking other people the only rock art that depicts violence between hunter gatherers comes from a unique northern australian sequence that began approximately years ago skeletal and artifactual evidence of paleolithic intergroup violence
ancient warfare is war as conducted from the beginnings of recorded history to the end of the ancient period in europe and the near east the end of antiquity is often equated with the fall of rome in the wars of the eastern roman empire on its southwestern asian and north african borders and the beginnings of the muslim conquests in the th century in china it can also be seen as ending with the growing role of mounted warriors needed to counter the ever growing threat from the north in the th century and the beginning of the tang dynasty in in india the ancient period ends with the decline of the gupta empire th century and the beginning of the muslim conquests there from the th century in japan the ancient period can be taken to end with the rise of feudalism in the kamakura period in the th century the difference between prehistoric and ancient warfare is less one of technology than of organization the development of first city states and then empires allowed warfare to change dramatically beginning in mesopotamia states produced sufficient agricultural surplus so that full time ruling elites and military commanders could emerge while the bulk of military forces were still farmers the society could support having them campaigning rather than working the land for a portion of each year thus organized armies developed for the first time these new armies could help states grow in size and became increasingly centralized early ancient armies continued to primarily use bows and spears the same weapons that had been developed in prehistoric times for hunting early armies in egypt and china followed a similar pattern of using massed infantry armed with bows and spears infantry were at this time the dominant form of war partially
medieval warfare is the warfare of the middle ages in europe technological cultural and social developments had forced a dramatic transformation in the character of warfare from antiquity changing military tactics and the role of cavalry and artillery in terms of fortification the middle ages saw the emergence of the castle in europe which then spread to southwestern asia si vis pacem para bellum if you want peace prepare for war publius flavius vegetius renatus wrote de re militari concerning military matters possibly in the late th century described by historian walter goffart as the bible of warfare throughout the middle ages de re militari was widely distributed through the latin west while western europe relied on a single text for the basis of its military knowledge the byzantine empire in southeastern europe had a succession of military writers though vegetius had no military experience and de re militari was derived from the works of cato and frontinus his books were the standard for military discourse in western europe from their production until the th century de re militari was divided into five books who should be a soldier and the skills they needed to learn the composition and structure of an army field tactics how to conduct and withstand sieges and the role of the navy according to vegetius infantry was the most important element of an army because it was cheap compared to cavalry and could be deployed on any terrain one of the tenets he put forward was that a general should only engage in battle when he was sure of victory or had no other choice as archaeologist robert liddiard explains pitched battles particularly in the eleventh and twelfth centuries were rare although his work was widely reproduced and over copies translations and extracts survive today
warfare of the early modern period is associated with the start of the widespread use of gunpowder and the development of suitable weapons to use the explosive including artillery and handguns for this reason the era is also referred to as the age of gunpowder warfare a concept introduced by michael roberts in the s this entire period is contained within the age of sail which characteristic dominated the era s naval tactics including the use of gunpowder in naval artillery all of the great powers of europe and the middle east were actively fighting numerous wars throughout this period grouped in rough geographical and chronological terms as gunpowder warfare was used in the mongol invasions of japan in and specifically in the form of explosive bombs fired from catapults against enemy soldiers japanese scrolls contain illustrations of bombs used by the yuan mongol forces against mounted samurai archaeological evidence of the use of gunpowder include the discovery of multiple shells of the explosive bombs in an underwater shipwreck off the shore of japan with x rays providing proof that they contained gunpowder in the earliest known european picture of a gun appeared in a manuscript by walter de milemete in petrarch wrote that the presence of cannons on the battlefield was as common and familiar as other kinds of arms early artillery played a limited role in the years war and it became indispensable in the italian wars of charles viii during his invasion of italy brought with him the first truly mobile siege train culverins and bombards mounted on wheeled carriages which could be deployed against an enemy stronghold immediately after arrival the period from saw a rapid advance in techniques of fortification in europe whereas medieval castles had relied on high walls to keep out attackers early

fourth generation warfare gw is conflict characterized by a blurring of the lines between war and politics combatants and civilians the term was first used in by a team of american analysts including william s lind citation needed to describe warfare s return to a decentralized form in terms of generational modern warfare the fourth generation signifies the nation states loss of their near monopoly on combat forces returning to modes of conflict common in pre modern times the simplest definition includes any war in which one of the major participants is not a state but rather a violent non state actor classical examples such as the slave uprising under spartacus predate the modern concept of warfare and are examples of this type of conflict fourth generation warfare is defined as conflicts which involve the following elements the concept was first described by the authors william s lind colonel keith nightengale us army captain john f schmitt usmc colonel joseph w sutton us army and lieutenant colonel gary i wilson usmcr in a marine corps gazette article entitled the changing face of war into the fourth generation in the concept was expanded upon by usmc colonel thomas x hammes ret in his well received book the sling and the stone the generations of warfare described by these authors are the use of fourth generation warfare can be traced to the cold war period as superpowers and major powers attempted to retain their grip on colonies and captured territories unable to withstand direct combat against bombers tanks and machine guns non state entities used tactics of education propaganda movement building secrecy terror and or confusion to overcome the technological gap fourth generation warfare has often involved an insurgent group or other violent non state actor trying to implement their own government

naval warfare is combat in and on seas oceans or any other major bodies of water such as large lakes and wide rivers mankind has fought battles on the sea for more than years even in the interior of large landmasses transportation before the advent of extensive railroads was extremely dependent upon rivers canals and other navigable waterways the latter were crucial in the development of the modern world in the united kingdom the low countries and northern germany for they enabled the bulk movement of goods and raw materials without which the industrial revolution would not have occurred prior to things moved by barge or sea or not much at all thus armies with their exorbitant needs for food ammunition and fodder were tied to the river valleys throughout the ages the oceanic influences throughout pre recorded history homeric legends e g troy and classical works like the odyssey underscore the past influences the persian empire united and strong couldn t prevail against the might of the athenian fleet combined with that of lesser city states in several attempts to conquer the greek city states phoenicia s and egypt s power carthage s and even rome s depended in no mean way upon control of the seas so too did the venetian republic dominate italy s city states thwart the ottoman empire and dominate commerce on the silk road and the mediterranean in general for centuries for three centuries the northmen commonly called the vikings raided and pillaged and went where they willed far into central russia and the ukraine and even to far off constantinople both via the black sea tributaries and through the strait of gibraltar many sea battles through history also provide a reliable source of shipwrecks for underwater archaeology a major example albeit not very

a weapon arm or armament is any device used with intent to inflict damage or harm to living beings structures or systems weapons are used to increase the efficacy and efficiency of activities such as hunting crime law enforcement self defense and warfare in a broader context weapons may be construed to include anything used to gain a strategic material or mental advantage over an adversary while just about any ordinary objects such as sticks stones cars or pencils can be used as weapons many are expressly designed for the purpose ranging from simple implements such as clubs swords and guns and to complicated modern intercontinental ballistic missiles biological and cyberweapons the use of objects as weapons has been observed among chimpanzees leading to speculation that early hominids first began to use weapons as early as five million years ago however this can not be confirmed using physical evidence because wooden clubs spears and unshaped stones would not have left an unambiguous record the earliest unambiguous weapons to be found are the sch ninger speere eight wooden throwing spears dated as being more than years old ancient weapons were evolutionary improvements of late neolithic implements but then significant improvements in materials and crafting techniques created a series of revolutions in military technology the development of metal tools beginning with copper during the copper age about bc and followed shortly by bronze led to the bronze age sword and similar weapons the first defensive structures and fortifications appeared in the bronze age indicating an increased need for security weapons designed to breach fortifications followed soon after for example the battering ram was in use by bc although early iron age swords were not superior to their bronze predecessors once iron working developed around bc in sub saharan africa iron began to
armoured warfare or tank warfare is the use of armoured fighting vehicles in modern warfare it is a major component of modern methods of war the premise of armoured warfare rests on the ability of troops to penetrate conventional defensive lines through use of manoeuvre by armoured units much of the application of armoured warfare depends on the use of tanks and related vehicles used by other supporting arms such as infantry fighting vehicles and self propelled artillery as well as mounted combat engineers and other support units the doctrine of armoured warfare was developed to break the static nature of world war i trench warfare on the western front and return to the th century school of thought that advocated manoeuvre and decisive battle outcomes in military strategy modern armoured warfare began with the need to break the tactical operational and strategic stalemates forced on commanders on the western front by the effectiveness of entrenched defensive infantry armed with machine guns known as trench warfare under these conditions any sort of advance was impossibly slow and occasioned massive casualties the development of the tank was motivated by the need to return manoeuvre to warfare and the only way to do so was to protect soldiers from small arms rifle machine gun fire as they were moving strategic use of tanks was slow to develop during and immediately after world war i partly due to technical limitations but also due to the prestige role traditionally accorded to horse mounted cavalry tanks were first developed in britain and france as a way of navigating the barbed wire and other obstacles of no man s land while remaining protected from machine gun fire the manoeuvrability of the tank would at least in theory regain armies the ability to flank enemy lines in
artillery is a class of large military weapons built to fire munitions far beyond the range and power of infantry s small arms early artillery development focused on the ability to breach fortifications and led to heavy fairly immobile siege engines as technology improved lighter more mobile field artillery developed for battlefield use this development continues today modern self propelled artillery vehicles are highly mobile weapons of great versatility providing the largest share of an army s total firepower in its earliest sense the word artillery referred to any group of soldiers primarily armed with some form of manufactured weapon or armour since the introduction of gunpowder and cannon the word artillery has largely meant cannon and in contemporary usage it usually refers to shell firing guns howitzers mortars rockets and guided missiles in common speech the word artillery is often used to refer to individual devices along with their accessories and fittings although these assemblages are more properly called equipments however there is no generally recognised generic term for a gun howitzer mortar and so forth the united states uses artillery piece but most english speaking armies use gun and mortar the projectiles fired are typically either shot if solid or shell if not shell is a widely used generic term for a projectile which is a component of munitions by association artillery may also refer to the arm of service that customarily operates such engines in some armies one arm has operated field coast anti aircraft artillery and some anti tank artillery in others these have been separate arms and in some nations coast has been a naval or marine responsibility in the th century technology based target acquisition devices such as radar and systems such as sound ranging and flash spotting emerged to acquire targets primarily for

cavalry from french cavalerie cf cheval horse or horsemen were soldiers or warriors who fought mounted on horseback cavalry were historically the most mobile of the combat arms an individual soldier in the cavalry is known by a number of designations such as cavalryman horseman dragoon or trooper the designation of cavalry was not usually given to any military force that used other animals such as camels mules or elephants infantry who moved on horseback but dismounted to fight on foot were known in the th and early th centuries as dragoons a class of mounted infantry which later evolved into cavalry proper while retaining their historic title from earliest times cavalry had the advantage of improved mobility making it an instrument which multiplied the fighting value of even the smallest forces allowing them to outflank and avoid to surprise and overpower to retreat and escape according to the requirements of the moment a man fighting from horseback also had the advantages of greater height speed and inertial mass over an opponent on foot another element of horse mounted warfare is the psychological impact a mounted soldier can inflict on an opponent the speed mobility and shock value of the cavalry was greatly appreciated and exploited in armed forces in the ancient and middle ages some forces were mostly cavalry particularly in nomadic societies of asia notably the mongol armies in europe cavalry became increasingly armoured heavy and eventually became known for the mounted knights during the th century cavalry in europe lost most of its armor ineffective against the muskets and cannon which were coming into use and by the mid th century armor had mainly fallen into disuse although some regiments retained a small thickened cuirass that offered protection against lances and sabres and some protection against shot
conventional warfare is a form of warfare conducted by using conventional weapons and battlefield tactics between two or more states in open confrontation the forces on each side are well defined and fight using weapons that primarily target the opponent s military it is normally fought using conventional weapons and not with chemical biological or nuclear weapons the general purpose of conventional warfare is to weaken or destroy the opponent s military thereby negating its ability to engage in conventional warfare in forcing capitulation however one or both sides may eventually resort to unconventional warfare tactics the state was first advocated by plato then found more acceptance in the consolidation of power under the roman catholic church european monarchs then gained power as the catholic church was stripped of temporal power and was replaced by the divine right of kings in the powers of europe signed the treaty of westphalia which ended the religious violence for purely political governance and outlook signifying the birth of the modern state within this statist paradigm only the state and its appointed representatives were allowed to bear arms and enter into war in fact war was only understood as a conflict between sovereign states kings strengthened this idea and gave it the force of law whereas previously any noble could start a war the monarchs of europe of necessity consolidated military power in response to the napoleonic war prussia was one country attempting to amass military power carl von clausewitz one of prussia s officers wrote on war a work rooted solely in the world of the state all other forms of intrastate conflict such as rebellion are not accounted for because in theoretical terms clausewitz could not account for warfare before the state however near the end of his life clausewitz grew increasingly
chemical warfare cw involves using the toxic properties of chemical substances as weapons this type of warfare is distinct from nuclear warfare and biological warfare which together make up nbc the military acronym for nuclear biological and chemical warfare or weapons all of which are considered weapons of mass destruction wmds none of these fall under the term conventional weapons which are primarily effective due to their destructive potential with proper protective equipment training and decontamination measures the primary effects of chemical weapons can be overcome many nations possess vast stockpiles of weaponized agents in preparation for wartime use the threat and the perceived threat have become strategic tools in planning both measures and counter measures chemical warfare is different from the use of conventional weapons or nuclear weapons because the destructive effects of chemical weapons are not primarily due to any explosive force the offensive use of living organisms such as anthrax is considered biological warfare rather than chemical warfare however the use of nonliving toxic products produced by living organisms e g toxins such as botulinum toxin ricin and saxitoxin is considered chemical warfare under the provisions of the chemical weapons convention cwc under this convention any toxic chemical regardless of its origin is considered a chemical weapon unless it is used for purposes that are not prohibited an important legal definition known as the general purpose criterion about different chemicals have been used or stockpiled as chemical warfare agents during the th century the entire class known as lethal unitary chemical agents and munitions have been scheduled for elimination by the cwc under the convention chemicals that are toxic enough to be used as chemical weapons or that may be used to manufacture such chemicals are divided into three groups according to their purpose and treatment chemical
a cyberweapon is a malware agent employed for military paramilitary or intelligence objectives citation needed requirements for the term vary widely the most common criteria seem to be for a malware agent which part of the distinction from other malware is that the agent is sponsored that is is commissioned developed and or actually used not by a black hat hacker or organized criminal group but instead by a state or a non state actor the latter potentially including terrorist groups and other entities proposed in gw doctrines a cyberweapon performs an action which would normally require a soldier or spy and which would be considered either illegal or an act of war if performed directly by a human agent of the sponsor during peacetime legal issues include violating the privacy of the target and the sovereignty of its host nation such actions include but are not limited to while a cyberweapon almost certainly results in either direct or indirect financial damages to the target group direct financial gains for the sponsor such as the transfer of funds are not a primary objective of this class of agent unlike malware used by script kiddies to organize botnets where the ownership physical location and normal role of the machines attacked is largely irrelevant cyberweapons show high selectivity in either or both of their employment and their operation before the attack cyberweapons usually identify the target using different methods likewise malware employed by fraudsters for the theft of personal or financial information demonstrates lower selectivity and wider distribution note that self replication is not a requirement as such not all cyberweapons are viruses and not all viruses are necessarily cyberweapons citation needed without this capability however an alternate vector is required to get the agent onto the target system s likewise compromised

the infantry is the branch of a military force that fights on foot as the troops who are intended to engage fight and defeat the enemy in face to face combat they bear the brunt of warfare and typically suffer the greatest number of casualties historically as the oldest branch of the combat arms the infantry are the tip of the spear of a modern army and continually undergo training that is more physically stressful and psychologically demanding than that of any other branch of the combat arms citation needed infantry can enter and maneuver in terrain that is inaccessible to military vehicles and employ crew served infantry weapons that provide greater and more sustained firepower the transport and delivery techniques of modern infantrymen to engage in battle include marching mechanised transport airborne by parachute or by air assault from helicopter and amphibious landing from the sea in english the th century term infantry ca s describes soldiers who walk to the battlefield and there engage fight and defeat the enemy in direct combat usually to take and occupy the terrain as describing the branch of the combat arms the term infantry derives from the french infanterie which in turn is derived from the italian fanteria and ultimately from the latin infantera the individual soldier term infantryman was not coined until the th century historically before the invention and the introduction of firearms to warfare the foot soldiers of previous eras armed with blunt and edged weapons and a shield also are considered and identified as infantrymen the term arose in sixteenth century spain which boasted the first professional standing army seen in europe since the days of rome it was common to appoint royal princes infantes to military commands and the men under them became known as infanteria in
nuclear warfare sometimes atomic warfare or thermonuclear warfare is a military conflict or political strategy in which nuclear weaponry is used to inflict damage on the enemy compared to conventional warfare nuclear warfare can be vastly more destructive in range and extent of damage and in a much shorter time a major nuclear exchange would have long term effects primarily from the fallout released and could also lead to a nuclear winter that could last for decades centuries or even millennia after the initial attack some analysts claim that with this potential nuclear winter side effect of a nuclear war almost every human on earth could starve to death other analysts who dismiss the nuclear winter hypothesis calculate that with nuclear weapon stockpiles at cold war highs in a surprise countervalue global nuclear war billions of casualties would have resulted but billions of people would nevertheless have survived so far only two nuclear weapons have been used in the course of warfare both by the united states near the end of world war ii on august a uranium gun type device code name little boy was detonated over the japanese city of hiroshima three days later on august a plutonium implosion type device code name fat man was detonated over the japanese city of nagasaki these two bombings resulted in the deaths of approximately civilians and military personnel after world war ii nuclear weapons were also developed by the soviet union the united kingdom france and the people s republic of china which contributed to the state of conflict and extreme tension that became known as the cold war in india and in pakistan two countries that were openly hostile toward each other developed nuclear weapons israel s and north korea are also thought to have developed stocks of nuclear

unconventional warfare abbreviated uw is the opposite of conventional warfare whereas conventional warfare is used to reduce the opponent s military capability unconventional warfare is an attempt to achieve military victory through acquiescence capitulation or clandestine support for one side of an existing conflict on the surface uw contrasts with conventional warfare in that forces or objectives are covert or not well defined tactics and weapons intensify environments of subversion or intimidation and the general or long term goals are coercive or subversive to a political body the general objective of unconventional warfare is to instill a belief that peace and security are not possible without compromise or concession specific objectives include inducement of war weariness curtailment of civilian standards of living and civil liberties associated with greater security demands economic hardship linked to the costs of war hopelessness to defend against assaults terror depression and disintegration of morale two original definition are claiming the intent of u s unconventional warfare efforts is to exploit a hostile power s political military economic and psychological vulnerabilities by developing and sustaining resistance forces to accomplish u s strategic objectives or according to john f kennedy there is another type of warfare new in its intensity ancient in its origin war by guerrillas subversives insurgents assassins war by ambush instead of by combat by infiltration instead of aggression seeking victory by eroding and exhausting the enemy instead of engaging him it preys on unrest the ultimate goal of this type of warfare is to motivate an enemy to stop attacking or resisting even if it has the ability to continue failing this a secondary objective can be to debilitate the enemy before a conventional attack unconventional warfare targets civilian population psychologically to win hearts and minds and only targets military and political bodies
military tactics are the science and art of organizing a military force and the techniques for combining and using weapons and military units to engage and defeat an enemy in battle changes in philosophy and technology have been reflected in changes to military tactics in contemporary military science tactics are the lowest of three planning levels i strategic ii operational and iii tactical the highest level of planning is strategy how force is translated into political objectives by bridging the means and ends of war the intermediate level operational level the conversion of strategy into tactics deals with formations of units in the vernacular tactical decisions are those made to achieve the greatest immediate value and strategic decisions are those made to achieve the greatest overall value irrespective of the immediate results of a tactical decision military tactics answer the questions of how best to deploy and employ forces on a small scale some practices have not changed since the dawn of warfare ambushes seeking and turning flanks maintaining reconnaissance creating and using obstacles and defences etc using ground to best advantage has not changed much either heights rivers swamps passes choke points and natural cover can all be used in multiple ways before the nineteenth century many military tactics were confined to battlefield concerns how to maneuver units during combat in open terrain nowadays specialized tactics exist for many situations for example for securing a room in a building what changes constantly is the technological dimension as well as the sociology of combatants one might wish to reflect on the technological and societal differences that produced such varying types of soldier or warrior greek hoplite roman legionary medieval knight turk mongol horse archer chinese crossbowman british redcoat or an air cavalry trooper each constrained by his weaponry logistics and
air combat manoeuvring also known as acm or dogfighting is the tactical art of moving turning and situating a fighter aircraft in order to attain a position from which an attack can be made on another aircraft it relies on offensive and defensive basic fighter manoeuvring bfm in to gain an advantage over an aerial opponent military aviation appeared in world war i where aircraft were initially used to spot enemy troop concentrations field gun positions and movements early aerial combat consisted of aviators shooting at one another with hand held weapons the first aircraft to be shot down by another aircraft which occurred on october was a german aviatik the pilot feldwebel wilhelm schlichting was shot with a hand gun wielded by observer louis quenault riding in a voisin type piloted by french sergeant joseph frantz the need to stop reconnaissance by enemy aircraft rapidly led to the development of fighter planes a class of aircraft designed specifically to destroy enemy aircraft fixed forward firing guns were found to be the most effective armament for most world war i era fighters but were nearly impossible to fire through the spinning propeller without destroying it roland garros working with morane saulnier a roplanes was the first to solve this problem by attaching steel deflector wedges to the propeller he achieved three kills but was shot down by ground fire landing behind german lines anthony fokker inspected the wreckage and improved the design by connecting the firing mechanism of the gun to the timing of the engine to allow the gun to fire through the propeller without hitting it as technology rapidly advanced new young aviators began to define the realm of air to air combat such as max immelmann oswald boelcke and lanoe hawker one of the greatest aces of
generally a battle is a conceptual component in the hierarchy of combat in warfare between two or more armed forces or combatants a war sometimes consists of many battles battles generally are well defined in duration area and force commitment wars and military campaigns are guided by strategy whereas battles take place on a level of planning and execution known as operational mobility german strategist carl von clausewitz stated that the employment of battles to achieve the object of war was the essence of strategy the definition of a battle cannot be arrived at solely through the names of historical battles many of which are misnomers the word battle is a loanword in english from the old french bataille first attested in from late latin battualia meaning exercise of soldiers and gladiators in fighting and fencing from late latin taken from germanic battuere beat from which the english word battery is also derived via middle english batri and comes from the staged battles in the colosseum in rome that may have numbered individuals the defining characteristic of the fight as a concept in military science has been a dynamic one through the course of military history changing with the changes in the organisation employment and technology of military forces while the english military historian sir john keegan suggested an ideal definition of battle as something which happens between two armies leading to the moral then physical disintegration of one or the other of them the origins and outcomes of battles can rarely be summarized so neatly in general a battle during the th century was and continues to be defined by the combat between opposing forces representing major components of total forces committed to a military campaign used to achieve specific military objectives where the duration of the battle is
for much of history humans have used some form of cavalry for war and as a result cavalry tactics have evolved over time tactically the main advantages of cavalry over infantry troops were greater mobility a larger impact and a higher position chariot tactics had been the basis for using the horse in war citation needed the chariot s advantage of speed was outdone by the agility of riding on horseback the ability of horsemen to pass more difficult terrain was also crucial to this change horsemen supplanted most light chariots in celtic warfare light chariots essedum prevailed among mounted troops for their ability to transport heavily armoured warriors and as mobile command platforms at first it was not considered effective to use weapons on horseback but rather to use the horse as transport mounted infantry would ride to battle and then dismount to fight for a long time riders and charioteers worked alongside each other in the cavalry the first recorded instance of mounted warriors are the mounted archers of the iranian tribes appearing in assyrian records from the th century bc mongolian troops had a buryat bow for showering the enemy with arrows from a safe distance the aim on horseback was better than in a jiggling chariot after it was discovered that the best time to shoot was while all the hooves of the horse were in the air nevertheless an archer in a chariot could shoot potentially stronger infantry bows javelins were employed as a powerful ranged weapon by many cavalries they were easy to handle on horseback two to ten javelins would be carried depending on their weight thrown javelins have less range than composite bows but often prevailed in use nevertheless due to the mass of the weapon there was a greater armour piercing
a charge is a manoeuvre in battle in which combatants advance towards their enemy at their best speed in an attempt to engage in close combat the charge is the dominant shock attack and has been the key tactic and decisive moment of many battles throughout history modern charges usually involve small groups against individual positions such as a bunker instead of large groups of combatants charging another group or a fortified line it may be assumed that the charge was practised in prehistoric warfare but clear evidence only comes with later literate societies the tactics of the classical greek phalanx included an ordered approach march with a final charge to contact in response to the introduction of firearms irish and scottish troops at the end of the th century developed a tactic that combined a volley of musketry with a rapid close to close combat using swords initially successful it was countered by effective discipline and the development of defensive bayonet tactics the development of the bayonet in the late th century led to the bayonet charge becoming the main infantry charge tactic through the th century and into the th as early as the th century tactical scholars were already noting that most bayonet charges did not result in close combat instead one side usually fled before actual bayonet fighting ensued the act of fixing bayonets has been held to be primarily connected to morale the making of a clear signal to friend and foe of a willingness to kill at close quarters ted hughes was the author that wrote the poem bayonet charge he was born and had died in ted had made his name as a poet in the late s and s and also wrote some well written children books including the iron man which
in military combat the concept of cover refers to anything which is capable of physically protecting an individual from enemy fire this differentiates it from the similar concept of concealment in that an object or area of concealment only affords the benefit of stealth not actual protection from small arms fire or artillery fragments an example of cover vs concealment would be sandbags vs tall grass cover may be a naturally occurring feature such as a rock or a tree stump or it may be a constructed feature such as a foxhole or a trench in some military services especially in the united states a uniform s hat is sometimes referred to officially as a cover as in hey soldier remove your cover or you re not in uniform without your cover it is a convention in the u s army that an armed soldier must wear cover while indoors to indicate that they are under arms many first and third person shooter video games encourage the player to utilize cover this gameplay mechanic is often referred to as a cover system

guerrilla warfare is a form of irregular warfare in which a small group of combatants such as paramilitary personnel armed civilians or irregulars use military tactics including ambushes sabotage raids petty warfare hit and run tactics and mobility to fight a larger and less mobile traditional military the term the diminutive form of war in spanish is usually translated as little war and the word guerrilla spanish pronunciation e ri a has been used to refer to the concept since the th century and perhaps earlier in correct spanish usage a person who is a member of a guerrilla is a guerrillero eri e o if male or a guerrillera if female this term became popular during the peninsular war when the spanish people rose against the napoleonic troops and fought against a highly superior army using the guerrilla strategy the term guerrilla was used in english as early as to refer to the fighters e g the town was taken by the guerrillas and also as in spanish to denote a group or band of such fighters however in most languages guerrilla still denotes the specific style of warfare the use of the diminutive evokes the differences in number scale and scope between the guerrilla army and the formal professional army of the state the strategy and tactics of guerrilla warfare tend to focus around the use of a small mobile force competing against a larger more unwieldy one the guerrilla focuses on organizing in small units depending on the support of the local population as well as taking advantage of terrain more accommodating of small units tactically the guerrilla army would avoid any confrontation with large units of enemy troops but seek and eliminate small groups of soldiers to minimize losses and exhaust the opposing force not limiting

a tactical objective is the immediate short term desired result of a given activity task or mission usually entrusted to the lower positioned management in a three tier organisation s structure of field or front desk middle and executive management while historically the term had been applied to military operations in the th century it has been increasingly applied in the fields of public safety such as policing and fire fighting commerce and trade planning and political and international relations policy a tactical objective is often an intermediate step to achieving an operational objective and as such requires decision making and problem solving skills applied during the execution of the tactical plan as part of the operational plan tactical objectives in the commercial use represent performance targets established by the middle management for achieving specific organisational outcomes for firefighters tactical objectives have historically focused on life safety as the priority in the plan when attending structure fires
trench warfare is a type of land warfare using occupied fighting lines consisting largely of trenches in which troops are significantly protected from the enemy s small arms fire and are substantially sheltered from artillery the most famous use of trench warfare is the western front in world war i it has become a byword for stalemate attrition sieges and futility in conflict trench warfare occurred when a revolution in firepower was not matched by similar advances in mobility resulting in a grueling form of warfare in which the defender held the advantage on the western front in both sides constructed elaborate trench and dugout systems opposing each other along a front protected from assault by barbed wire the area between opposing trench lines known as no man s land was fully exposed to artillery fire from both sides attacks even if successful often sustained severe casualties the efficacy of trench warfare was effectively ended with the invention and adoption of the tank field works are as old as armies roman legions when in the presence of an enemy entrenched camps nightly when on the move in the early modern era they were used to block possible lines of advance for example nor were fortifications restricted to european powers elaborate trench and bunker systems were independently developed by the maori who successfully employed them as early as the s to withstand british cannon muskets and an experimental poison gas mortar in the new zealand wars british casualty rates of up to percent such as at the battle of ohaeawai in proved contemporary firepower was insufficient to dislodge defenders from a trench system field works were later employed in the american civil war most notably in the sieges of petersburg and vicksburg the paraguayan war the second anglo boer war and
in the field of military theory the operational level of war also called the operational art as derived from russian or the operational warfare represents the level of command that coordinates the minute details of tactics with the overarching goals of strategy during the th and early th centuries the synonymous term grand tactics was often applied to describe the manoeuvring of troops not tactically engaged while in the late th century and beyond the first world war the term minor strategy was also in use through the second world war by some military commentators the confusion over terminology was brought up in professional military publications that sought to identify slightly different shades of meaning such as tactics major tactics minor tactics grand strategy major strategy and minor strategy operational mobility beginning as a concept during the period of the mechanisation of armed forces became a method of managing the movement of forces by strategic commanders from the staging area to their tactical area of responsibility at first the operational level of war was conceived by the military theorists to describe the movement and logistics necessary for the coordinated concentration of many units for an offensive operational warfare is considered on a large enough scale that the tactical factors such as line of sight and the time of day are not recognizable but smaller than the strategic scale where production politics and diplomacy come into play formations are of the operational level if they are able to conduct operational movement on their own that is operating independently and are of sufficient size to be directly handled or have a significant impact citation needed on the enemy s decision making at the strategic level of the military campaign or even the war these methods of conducting operational mobility were pioneered citation

a deep operation also known as soviet deep battle russian glubokaya operatsiya was a military theory developed by the soviet union for its armed forces during the s and s it was developed by a number of influential military writers such as vladimir triandafillov and mikhail tukhachevsky who endeavoured to create a military strategy with its own specialised operational art and tactics the concept of deep operations was a national strategy tailored to the economic cultural and geopolitical position of the soviet union in the aftermath of several failures or defeats in the russo japanese war first world war and polish soviet war the soviet high command stavka focused on developing new methods for the conduct of war this new approach considered military strategy and tactics but also introduced a new intermediate level of military art operations the soviet union was the first country to officially distinguish the third level of military thinking which occupied the position between strategy and tactics citation needed using these templates the soviets developed the concept of deep battle and by it had become part of the red army field regulations deep operations had two phases the tactical deep battle followed by the exploitation of tactical success known as the conduct of deep battle operations deep battle envisaged the breaking of the enemy s forward defences or tactical zones for fresh uncommitted mobile operational reserves to exploit by breaking into the strategic depth of an enemy front the goal of a deep operation was to inflict a decisive strategic defeat on the enemy and render the defence of their front more difficult impossible or indeed irrelevant unlike most other doctrines deep battle stressed combined arms cooperation at all levels strategic operational and tactical russian military thinking had changed little over the course of three centuries
maneuver warfare or manoeuvre warfare is a military strategy that advocates attempting to defeat the enemy by incapacitating their decision making through shock and disruption methods of war stand on a continuum between maneuver warfare and attrition warfare the focus on achieving victory through killing or capturing the enemy maneuver warfare advocates recognize that all warfare involves both maneuver and attrition maneuver warfare concepts have historically been stressed by militaries which are smaller more cohesive better trained or more technically able than attrition warfare counterparts the term tactical maneuver is used by maneuver warfare theorists to refer to movement by forces to gain advantageous position relative to the enemy as opposed to its use in the phrase maneuver warfare the idea of using rapid movement to keep an enemy off balance is as old as war itself however changing technology such as the development of cavalry and mechanized vehicles has led to increased interest in the concepts of maneuver warfare and its role on modern battlefields military orthodoxy specify believes that with some exceptions most battles between established armies have historically been fought based on an attrition warfare strategy closer examination however reveals this view is not universally held and many military doctrines and cultures are based on replete historical examples of maneuver warfare the attritionalists view of warfare involves moving masses of men and material against enemy strongpoints with the emphasis on the destruction of the enemy s physical assets success as measured by enemy combatants killed equipment and infrastructure destroyed and territory taken and or occupied attrition warfare tends to utilize rigidly centralized command structures that require little or no creativity or initiative from lower level leadership also called top down or command push tactics maneuver warfare doctrine sees styles of warfare as a spectrum with attrition warfare
the operational manoeuvre group omg was a soviet army organisational maneuver warfare concept created during the early s to replace the cavalry mechanized group which performed the deep operations on the eastern front during the second world war the deep operations theory developed in cooperation between the red army and wehrmacht theorists in the s later influenced the blitzkrieg operations and echelon based doctrine in the soviet army doctrine the operational manoeuvre groups would be inserted to exploit a breakthrough by a front during a potential war against nato in europe in the soviet doctrine after the motor rifle units heavily supported by artillery helicopters and close air support aircraft would have broken nato front the operational manoeuvre groups would be inserted to exploit the breakthrough using elements of or whole tank armies at the front level an operational manoeuvre group could include two tank divisions and three to five motor rifle divisions to counter the omg s threat nato deployed a large number of special forces units with the task of sabotaging and attacking the rear services russian tyl logistical depots in particular fuel to slow the omg advance permitting nato units to counter attack the base of the insertion sector as was the practice of german commanders during the second world war citation needed
military strategy is a set of ideas implemented by military organizations to pursue desired strategic goals derived from the greek strategos strategy when it appeared in use during the th century was seen in its narrow sense as the art of the general the art of arrangement of troops military strategy deals with the planning and conduct of campaigns the movement and disposition of forces and the deception of the enemy the father of western modern strategic study carl von clausewitz defined military strategy as the employment of battles to gain the end of war b h liddell hart s definition put less emphasis on battles defining strategy as the art of distributing and applying military means to fulfill the ends of policy hence both gave the pre eminence to political aims over military goals sun tzu is often considered as the father of eastern military strategy and has influenced greatly the chinese japanese korean and vietnamese historical and modern war tactics the art of war by sun tzu grew in popularity and saw practical use in western society as well it continues to influence many competitive endeavors in asia europe and america including culture politics and business as well as modern warfare the eastern military strategy differs from the western by focusing more on asymmetric warfare and deception strategy differs from tactics in that strategy refers to the employment of all of a nation s military capabilities through high level and long term planning development and procurement to guarantee security or victory tactics is the military science employed to secure objectives defined as part of the military strategy especially the methods whereby men equipment aircraft ships and weapons are employed and directed against an enemy unreliable source military strategy is the planning and execution of the contest between groups
attrition warfare is a military strategy in which a belligerent attempts to win a war by wearing down the enemy to the point of collapse through continuous losses in personnel and materiel the war will usually be won by the side with greater such resources the word attrition comes from the latin root atterere to rub against similar to the grinding down of the opponent s forces in attrition warfare military theorists and strategists like sun tzu have viewed attrition warfare as something to be avoided in the sense that attrition warfare represents an attempt to grind down an opponent through superior numbers it represents the opposite of the usual principles of war where one attempts to achieve decisive victories by using minimal necessary resources and in minimal amount of time through maneuver concentration of force surprise and the like on the other hand a side which perceives itself to be at a marked disadvantage in maneuver warfare or unit tactics may deliberately seek out attrition warfare to neutralize its opponent s advantages if the sides are nearly evenly matched the outcome of a war of attrition is likely to be a pyrrhic victory the difference between war of attrition and other forms of war is somewhat artificial since war always contains an element of attrition however one can be said to pursue a strategy of attrition when one makes it the main goal to cause gradual attrition to the opponent eventually amounting to unacceptable or unsustainable levels for the opponent while limiting one s own gradual losses to acceptable and sustainable levels this should be seen as opposed to other main goals such as the conquest of some resource or territory or an attempt to cause the enemy great losses in a single stroke e g by encirclement and
military deception refers to attempts to mislead enemy forces during warfare this is usually achieved by creating or amplifying an artificial fog of war via psychological operations information warfare visual deception and other methods as a form of strategic use of information disinformation it overlaps with psychological warfare to the degree that any enemy that falls for the deception will lose confidence when it is revealed he may hesitate when confronted with the truth deception in warfare dates back to early history the art of war an ancient chinese military treatise puts great emphasis on the tactic in modern times military deception has developed as a fully fledged doctrine misinformation and visual deception were employed during world war i and came into even greater prominence during world war ii in the buildup to the invasion of normandy the allies executed one of the largest deceptions in military history operation bodyguard helping them achieve full tactical surprise broadly military deception may take both strategic and tactical forms deception across a strategic battlefield was uncommon until the modern age particularly in the world wars of the th century but tactical deception on individual battlefields dates back to early history in a practical sense military deception employs visual misdirection misinformation for example via double agents and psychology to make the enemy believe something that is untrue the use of military camouflage especially on a large scale is a form of deception the russian loanword maskirovka literally masking is used to describe the soviet union and russia s military doctrine of surprise through deception in which camouflage plays a significant role there are numerous examples of deception activities employed throughout the history of warfare such as deception has been a part of warfare from the dawn of history at first it fell to individual
a strategic defence is a type of military planning doctrine and a set of combat activities used for the purpose of deterring resisting and repelling a strategic offensive conducted as either a territorial or airspace invasion or a naval offensive to interrupt shipping lane traffic as a form of economic warfare strategic defensive need not be passive in nature and often involves military deception propaganda and psychological warfare as well as pre emptive strategies all forms of military force are included in the planning and often civil defence organisations are also included in military theory strategic defensive thinking seeks to understand and appreciate the theoretical and historical background to any given war and conflict scenario facing the decision makers at the national level the requirement of the decision makers for the strategic defence analysts is usually for providing a detailed understanding of strategic and defence issues of relevance to the national and regional relations and intentions some of the more common issues encountered by strategic defence planners include strategic defensive is also a predominant peace time posture of most nation states in the world at any one time although the national military intelligence services are always conducting operations to discover offensive threats to security to ensure adequate warning is provided to bring armed forces to a state of combat readiness in terms of scale of combat the strategic defensive is considered either a war that can last from days to generations or a military campaign as a phase of the war involving a series of operations delimited by time and space and with specific major achievable goal allocated to a defined part of the available armed force as a campaign a strategic defence may consist of several battles some of which may be offensive in nature or may result in
an offensive is a military operation that seeks through aggressive projection of armed force to occupy territory gain an objective or achieve some larger strategic operational or tactical goal another term for an offensive often used by the media is invasion or the more general attack the offensive was considered a pre eminent means of producing victory although with the recognition of a defensive phase at some stage of the execution a quick guide to the size or scope of the offensive is to consider the number of troops involved in the side initiating the offensive offensives are largely conducted as a means to secure initiative in a confrontation between opponents they can be waged on land at sea or in the air naval offensives such as the japanese attack on pearl harbor can have wide ranging implications for national strategies and require significant logistical commitment to destroy enemy naval capabilities it can also be used to interdict enemy shipping such as world war ii s battle of the atlantic naval offensives can also be tactical in nature such as operation coronado ix conducted by the united states navy s mobile riverine force during the vietnam war an air offensive is an operation that can describe any number of different types of operations usually restricted to specific types of aircraft the offensives conducted with use of fighter aircraft are predominantly concerned with establishing air superiority in a given air space or over a given territory a bomber offensive is sometimes also known as a strategic bombing offensive and was prominently used by the allies on a large scale during world war ii use of ground attack aircraft in support of ground offensives can be said to be an air offensive such as that performed in the opening phase of the
a counter offensive is the term used by the military to describe large scale usually strategic offensive operations by forces that had successfully halted the enemy s offensive while occupying defensive positions the counter offensive is executed after exhausting the enemy s front line troops and after the enemy reserves had been committed to combat and proven incapable of breaching defences but before the enemy has had the opportunity to assume new defensive positions sometimes the counter offensive can be of a more limited operational maneuver nature with more limited objectives rather than those seeking attainment of a strategic goal a counter offensive as considered by clausewitz to be the most efficient means of forcing the attacker to abandon offensive plans counter offensives can be executed not only on land but also by the naval forces and air forces strategic counter offensives have been recorded by military historians in many wars throughout military history although not always known as such because they are usually described by historians in conjunction with the defensive phase such as the battle of moscow a counterattack is the tactical and sometimes smaller operational equivalent of the counter offensive
a strategic military goal is used in strategic military operation plans to define the desired end state of a war or a campaign usually it entails either a strategic change in an enemy s military posture intentions or ongoing operations or achieving a strategic victory over the enemy that ends the conflict although the goal can be set in terms of diplomatic or economic conditions defined by purely territorial gains or the evidence that the enemy s will to fight has been broken sometimes the strategic goal can be to limit the scope of the conflict it is the highest level of organisational achievement in a military organisation and is usually defined by the national defence policy in terms of goal assignment it corresponds to operations performed by a front or a fleet on a theatre scale and by an army group or during the world war ii by a red army front a strategic goal is achieved by reaching specific strategic objectives that represent intermediary and incremental advances within the overall strategic plan this is necessary because high level strategic goals are often abstract and therefore difficult to assess in terms of achievement without referring to some specific often physical objectives however aside from the obstacles used by the enemy to prevent achievement of the strategic goal inappropriate technological capabilities and operational weakness in combat may prevent fulfilment of the strategic plan as an example these are illustrated by the failure of the royal air force s bomber command during the winter of a critical product of the analysis which leads to the strategic decision to use military force is determination of the national goal to be achieved by that application of force however analysis of military history abounds with examples of the two factors that plague goal setting
naval strategy is the planning and conduct of war at sea the naval equivalent of military strategy on land naval strategy and the related concept of maritime strategy concerns the overall strategy for achieving victory at sea including the planning and conduct of campaigns the movement and disposition of naval forces by which a commander secures the advantage of fighting at a place convenient to himself and the deception of the enemy naval tactics deal with the execution of plans and maneuvering of ships or fleets in battle the great aims of a fleet in war must be to keep the coast of its own country free from attack to secure the freedom of its trade and to destroy the enemy s fleet or confine it to port the first and second of these aims can be attained by the successful achievement of the third the destruction or paralysis of the hostile fleet a fleet that secures the freedom of its own communications from attack is said to have command of the sea naval strategy is fundamentally different from military strategy at sea there is no territory to occupy apart from the fisheries and more recently offshore oilfields there are no economic assets that can be denied to the enemy and no resources that a fleet can exploit while an army can live off the land a fleet must rely on whatever supplies it carries with it or can be brought to it the british admiral the earl of torrington allegedly originated the expression fleet in being faced with a clearly superior french fleet in the summer of during the war of the grand alliance torrington proposed avoiding battle except under very favourable conditions until the arrival of reinforcements by maintaining his fleet in being he would prevent the french
grand strategy also called high strategy comprises the purposeful employment of all instruments of power available to a security community military historian b h liddell hart says about grand strategy t he role of grand strategy higher strategy is to co ordinate and direct all the resources of a nation or band of nations towards the attainment of the political object of the war the goal defined by fundamental policy grand strategy should both calculate and develop the economic resources and man power of nations in order to sustain the fighting services also the moral resources for to foster the people s willing spirit is often as important as to possess the more concrete forms of power grand strategy too should regulate the distribution of power between the several services and between the services and industry moreover fighting power is but one of the instruments of grand strategy which should take account of and apply the power of financial pressure and not least of ethical pressure to weaken the opponent s will furthermore while the horizons of strategy is bounded by the war grand strategy looks beyond the war to the subsequent peace it should not only combine the various instruments but so regulate their use as to avoid damage to the future state of peace for its security and prosperity grand strategy expands on the traditional idea of strategy in three ways issues of grand strategy typically include the choice of primary versus secondary theaters in war distribution of resources among the various services the general types of armaments manufacturing to favor and which international alliances best suit national goals grand strategy has considerable overlap with foreign policy but grand strategy focuses primarily on the military implications of policy the political leadership of a country typically directs grand strategy

the philosophy of war examines war beyond the typical questions of weaponry and strategy inquiring into such things as the meaning and etiology of war the relationship between war and human nature and the ethics of war certain aspects of the philosophy of war may overlap with the philosophy of history political philosophy and the philosophy of law perhaps the greatest and most influential work in the philosophy of war is on war by carl von clausewitz it combines observations on strategy with questions about human nature and the purpose of war clausewitz especially examines the teleology of war whether war is a means to an end outside itself or whether it can be an end in itself he concludes that the latter cannot be so and that war is politics by different means i e that war must not exist only for its own sake it must serve some purpose for the state leo tolstoy s novel war and peace contains frequent philosophical digressions on the philosophy of war and broader metaphysical speculations derived from christianity and from tolstoy s observations of the napoleonic wars it was influential on later thought about war tolstoy s christian centered philosophy of war especially his essays a letter to a hindu and the kingdom of god is within you was a direct influence on gandhi s hinduism centered non violent resistance philosophy while sun tzu s the art of war focusses mostly on weaponry and strategy instead of philosophy his observations are often broadened into a philosophy applied in situations extending well beyond war itself see the main wikipedia article on the art of war for a discussion of the application of sun tzu s philosophy to areas other than war parts of niccol machiavelli s masterpiece the prince as well as

military intelligence is a military discipline that exploits a number of information collection and analysis approaches to provide guidance and direction to commanders in support of their decisions this is achieved by providing an assessment of available data from a wide range of sources directed towards the commanders mission requirements or responding to focused questions as part of the operational or campaign planning activity in order to provide an informed analysis the commander s information requirements are first identified these information requirements are then incorporated into a process of intelligence collection analysis and dissemination areas of study may include the operational environment hostile friendly and neutral forces the civilian population in an area of combat operations and other broader areas of interest intelligence activities are conducted at all levels from tactical to strategic in peacetime the period of transition to war and during a war itself most governments maintain a military intelligence capability to provide analytical and information collection personnel in both specialist units and from other arms and services the military intelligence capabilities interact with civilian intelligence capabilities to inform the spectrum of political and military activities personnel selected for intelligence duties may be selected for their analytical abilities and personal intelligence before receiving formal training intelligence operations are carried out throughout the hierarchy of political and military activity strategic intelligence is concerned with broad issues such as economics political assessments military capabilities and intentions of foreign nations and increasingly non state actors such intelligence may be scientific technical tactical diplomatic or sociological but these changes are analyzed in combination with known facts about the area in question such as geography demographics and industrial capacities operational intelligence is focused on support or denial of intelligence at operational tiers operational tier is below the strategic level of leadership and refers
military ranks are a system of hierarchical relationships in armed forces police intelligence agencies or other institutions organized along military lines usually uniforms denote the bearer s rank by particular insignia affixed to the uniforms ranking systems have been known for most of military history to be advantageous for military operations in particular with regards to logistics command and coordination as time continued and military operations became larger and more complex military ranks increased and ranking systems themselves became more complex within modern armed forces the use of ranks is almost universal communist states have sometimes abolished rank e g the soviet red army the chinese people s liberation army and the albanian army only to re establish them after encountering operational difficulties of command and control the term rank comes from persian rang meaning colour as the sassanid army was ranked and dressed by colour from bc the athenians annually elected ten individuals to the rank of strategos one for each of the ten tribes that had been created with the founding of the democracy strategos literally means strategist which was considered the army leader and so it is usually translated as general originally these generals worked together with the old polemarchos warlord but over time the latter figure was absorbed into the generalship each of the ten generals would rotate as polemarch for one day and during this day his vote would serve as tie breaker if necessary the ten generals were equal to one another there was no hierarchy among them however a basic form of democracy was in effect for example at the battle of marathon in bc the generals determined the battle plan by majority vote particular assignments however might have been given to individual generals inevitably there was a regular division of responsibilities the
a military staff often referred to as general staff army staff navy staff or air staff within the individual services is a group of officers and enlisted personnel that are responsible for the administrative operational and logistical needs of its unit it provides bi directional flow of information between a commanding officer and subordinate military units a staff also provides an executive function where it filters information needed by the commander or shunts unnecessary information one of the key purposes of a military staff is to provide accurate timely information which includes the results of contingency planning on which command decisions are based a goal is being able to suggest approaches or help produce well informed decisions that will effectively manage and conserve unit resources in addition to generating information the staff also manages the flow of communication within the unit and around it while controlled information flow toward the commander is a priority those useful or contingent in nature are communicated to lower level units and or through their respective staffs if the information is not pertinent to the unit it is redirected to the command level which can best utilize the condition or information staffs are generally the first to know of issues that affect its group issues that require major decisions affecting the unit s operational capability are communicated to the commanding officer however not all issues will be handled by the commander smaller matters that arise are given to a more appropriate tasker within the unit to be handled and resolved which would otherwise be an unnecessary distraction for the commanding officer who already makes numerous decisions every day in addition a staff aims to carefully craft any useful situations and utilize that information in a generic command staff more seasoned and senior officers oversee staff
military technology is the application of technology for use in warfare it comprises the kinds of technology that are distinctly military in nature and not civilian in application usually because they lack useful or legal civilian applications or are dangerous to use without appropriate military training military technology is often researched and developed by scientists and engineers specifically for use in battle by the armed forces many new technologies came as a result of the military funding of science weapons engineering is the design development testing and lifecycle management of military weapons and systems it draws on the knowledge of several traditional engineering disciplines including mechanical engineering electrical engineering mechatronics electro optics aerospace engineering materials engineering and chemical engineering the line is porous military inventions have been brought into civilian use throughout history with sometimes minor modification if any and civilian innovations have similarly been put to military use this section is divided into the broad cultural developments that affected military technology the first use of stone tools may have begun during the paleolithic period about two million years ago and evolved through the pleistocene period about years ago stone tools are evidence of the earliest technological development to shape and sharpen minerals such as chert flint and obsidian see knapping into bludgeoning devices and other trauma weapons the earliest evidence of warfare between tribes of humans date back to the neolithic period new stone age at catalhuyuk in anatolia and jericho about to bce where primitive fortifications and stone weapons have been found humans entered the bronze age as they learned to smelt copper into an alloy with tin to make more effective and specialized weapons like swords spears and shields in asia where copper tin ores are rare this development was delayed until trading in bronze began in
military logistics is the discipline of planning and carrying out the movement and maintenance of military forces in its most comprehensive sense it is those aspects or military operations that deal with the word logistics is derived from the greek adjective logistikos meaning skilled in calculating the first administrative use of the word was in roman and byzantine times when there was a military administrative official with the title logista at that time the word apparently implied a skill involved in numerical computations historically supplies for an army were first acquired by foraging or looting especially in the case of food and fodder although if traveling through a desolated region or staying in one place for too long resources could quickly be exhausted a second method was for the army to bring along what was needed whether by ships pack animals wagons or carried on the backs of the soldiers themselves this allowed the army some measure of self sufficiency and up through to the th century most of the ammunition a soldier needed for an entire campaign could be carried on their person however this method led to an extensive baggage train which could slow down the army s advance and the development of faster firing weapons soon outpaced an army s ability to supply itself starting with the industrial revolution new technological technical and administrative advances led to a third method that of maintaining supplies in a rear area and transporting them to the front this led to a logistical revolution which began in the th century and drastically improved the capabilities of modern armies while making them highly dependent on this new system starting in the late sixteenth century armies in europe greatly increased in size upwards of or more in some cases this increase in size
materiel from the french mat riel for equipment or hardware related to the word material and sometimes so spelled in english is military technology and supplies in military and commercial supply chain management in a military context materiel relates to the specific needs of a force to complete a specific mission the term is also often used in a general sense men and materiel to describe the needs of a functioning army materiel management consists of continuing actions relating to planning organizing directing coordinating controlling and evaluating the application of resources to ensure the effective and economical support of military forces see also team effectiveness it includes provisioning cataloging requirements determination acquisition distribution maintenance and disposal the terms materiel management materiel control inventory control inventory management and supply management are synonymous military materiel is often shipped to and used in severe climates without controlled warehouses and material handling equipment packaging and labeling often needs to meet stringent technical specifications to help ensure proper delivery and final use materiel in the commercial distribution context comprises the items being moved by the services of or as the products of the business as distinct from those involved in operating the business itself
military supply chain management is a cross functional approach to procuring producing and delivering products and services for military applications the broad management scope includes sub suppliers suppliers internal information and funds flow a supply is the procurement distribution maintenance while in storage and salvage of supplies including the determination of kind and quantity of supplies the producer phase of a military supply extends from determination of procurement schedules to acceptance of finished supplies by the military services the consumer phase of a military supply extends from receipt of finished supplies by the military services through issue for use or consumption the supply chain is the linked activities associated with providing material from a raw material stage to an end user as a finished good supply control is the process by which an item of supply is controlled within the supply system including requisitioning receipt storage stock control shipment disposition identification and accounting the supply point is a location where supplies services and materials are located and issued these locations are temporary and mobile normally being occupied for up to hours military logistics is the science of planning and carrying out the movement and maintenance of armed forces in its most comprehensive sense those aspects of military operations that deal with a design and development acquisition storage movement distribution maintenance evacuation and disposition of materiel b movement evacuation and hospitalization of personnel c acquisition or construction maintenance operation and disposition of facilities and d acquisition or furnishing of services the major difference between the concept of logistic management and supply chain management is the level of information gathered processes analysed and used for decision making an scm based organization not only having concerns with its immediate clients but also handles and forecasts the factors affecting directly or indirectly their supplier
asymmetric warfare or asymmetric engagement is war between belligerents whose relative military power differs significantly or whose strategy or tactics differ significantly this is typically a war between a standing professional army and an insurgency or resistance movement asymmetric warfare can describe a conflict in which the resources of two belligerents differ in essence and in the struggle interact and attempt to exploit each other s characteristic weaknesses such struggles often involve strategies and tactics of unconventional warfare the weaker combatants attempting to use strategy to offset deficiencies in quantity or quality such strategies may not necessarily be militarized this is in contrast to symmetric warfare where two powers have similar military power and resources and rely on tactics that are similar overall differing only in details and execution the term is also frequently used to describe what is also called guerrilla warfare insurgency terrorism counterinsurgency and counterterrorism essentially violent conflict between a formal military and an informal less equipped and supported undermanned but resilient opponent asymmetric warfare is a form of irregular warfare the popularity of the term dates from andrew j r mack s article why big nations lose small wars in world politics in which asymmetric referred simply to a significant disparity in power between opposing actors in a conflict power in this sense is broadly understood to mean material power such as a large army sophisticated weapons an advanced economy and so on mack s analysis was largely ignored in its day but the end of the cold war sparked renewed interest among academics by the late s new research building on mack s insights was beginning to mature and after the u s military began once again seriously to consider the problems associated with asymmetric warfare citation needed discussion since has been complicated by the
broken backed war theory is a concept used to describe a form of conflict that could potentially transpire after a massive nuclear exchange assuming that following a nuclear exchange all the participants have not been utterly annihilated there may arise a scenario unique to military strategy and theory one in which all or some of the parties involved strive to continue fighting until the other side is decisively defeated broken backed war theory was first formally elaborated on in the british defence white paper to describe what would presumably happen after a massive nuclear exchange the american new look strategy of utterly rejected the notion of broken backed war they dropped the term from the white paper and the phrase has since faded from common usage dr klaus knorr purported that in a broken backed war scenario only military weapons and vehicles on hand prior to the sustained hostilities would be of use as the economic potential of both sides would be at least in theory utterly shattered do current predictions on the nature of future warfare exhaust not only all possible but all likely contingencies it can be granted that a long drawn out and massive war conducted with conventional by which i mean modernized but nonatomic weapons is so unlikely to occur that it may be safely neglected as a contingency there definitely is no future for world war ii it can also be granted that once unlimited thermonuclear war has broken out there is no economic war potential to be mobilized for its conduct even a broken backed war would have to be fought overwhelmingly if not entirely with munitions on hand at the start of the fighting klaus knorr herman kahn in his tome on thermonuclear war has posited that a broken backed war is implausible
a cold war or cold warfare is a state of conflict between nations that does not involve direct military action but is pursued primarily through economic and political actions propaganda acts of espionage or proxy wars waged by surrogates the surrogates are typically states that are satellites of the conflicting nations i e nations allied to them or under their political influence opponents in a cold war will often provide economic or military aid such as weapons tactical support or military advisors to lesser nations involved in conflicts with the opposing country the expression cold war has historically had a number of meanings in the fourteenth century don juan manuel referred to the conflict between christianity and islam as a cold war and defined the distinguishing characteristics between a cold war and a hot war war that is very fierce and very hot ends either with death or peace whereas a cold war neither brings peace nor confers honour on those who wage it then after world war ii george orwell used the term in the essay you and the atomic bomb published october in the british newspaper tribune contemplating a world living in the shadow of the threat of nuclear war he warned of a peace that is no peace which he called a permanent cold war orwell directly referred to that war as the ideological confrontation between the soviet union and the western powers moreover in the observer of march orwell wrote that a fter the moscow conference last december russia began to make a cold war on britain and the british empire the definition which has now become fixed is of a war waged through indirect conflict the first use of the term in this sense to describe the post world war ii geopolitical tensions between the
irregular warfare is warfare in which one or more combatants are irregular military rather than regular forces guerrilla warfare is a form of irregular warfare and so is asymmetric warfare the overuse of the term warfare in contemporary military terminology to describe both a specific type of engagement and the type of forces participating in it can lead to false conclusions a guerrilla unit that is made of commandos is a regular unit conducting asymmetric warfare whereas an irregular band of fighters can engage combat in a tactical infantry firefight if well led and well equipped fighting like a conventional unit to eschew false assumptions perhaps it is a better idea not to take insurgency terminology at face value before verifying the status of the all the belligerent parties involved irregular warfare favors indirect and asymmetric warfare approaches though it may employ the full range of military and other capabilities in order to erode the adversary s power influence and will it is inherently a protracted struggle that will test the resolve of a state and its strategic partners concepts associated with irregular warfare are older than the term itself the word regular is used in the term regular armed forces which comes from the third geneva convention of the international committee of the red cross icrc is a non governmental organization primarily responsible for and most closely associated with the drafting and successful completion of the third geneva convention relative to the treatment of prisoners of war gpw the icrc provided commentary saying that regular armed forces satisfy four hague conventions and hague iv conditions in other words regular forces must satisfy the following criteria on the other hand irregular forces is a term in international humanitarian law referring to a category of combatants consisting of individuals forming part
a mercenary is a person who takes part in an armed conflict who is not a national or a party to the conflict and is motivated to take part in the hostilities by the desire for private gain in other words a mercenary is a person who fights for personal gains of money or other recompense instead of fighting for the ideological interests of a country whether they be for or against the existing government in the last century and as reflected in the geneva convention mercenaries have increasingly come to been seen as less entitled to protections by rules of war than non mercenaries however whether or not a person is a mercenary may be a matter of degree as financial and national interests may overlap protocol additional gc apgc is a amendment protocol to the geneva conventions article of the protocol provides the most widely accepted international definition of a mercenary though not endorsed by some countries including the united states the protocol additional to the geneva conventions of august and relating to the protection of victims of international armed conflicts protocol i june states art mercenaries all the criteria a f must be met according to the geneva convention for a combatant to be described as a mercenary according to the gc iii a captured soldier must be treated as a lawful combatant and therefore as a protected person with prisoner of war status until facing a competent tribunal gc iii art that tribunal using criteria in apgc or some equivalent domestic law may decide that the soldier is a mercenary at that juncture the mercenary soldier becomes an unlawful combatant but still must be treated with humanity and in case of trial shall not be deprived of the rights of fair and regular trial being still
in the military sciences the term military campaign applies to large scale long duration significant military strategy plan incorporating a series of inter related military operations or battles forming a distinct part of a larger conflict often called a war the term derives from the plain of campania a place of annual wartime operations by the armies of the roman republic a military campaign denotes the time during which a given military force conducts combat operations in a given area often referred to as ao area of operation a military campaign may be executed by either a single armed service or as a combined services campaign conducted by land naval air cyber and space forces the purpose of a military campaign is to achieve a particular desired resolution of a military conflict as its strategic goal this is constrained by resources geography and or season a campaign is measured relative to the technology used by the belligerents to achieve goals and while in the pre industrial europe was understood to be that between the planting late spring and harvest times late autumn it has been shortened during the post industrial period to a few weeks however due to the nature of campaign goals usually campaigns last several months or even a year as defined by trevor n dupuy a campaign is a phase of a war involving a series of operations related in time and space and aimed towards a single specific strategic objective or result in the war a campaign may include a single battle but more often it comprises a number of battles over a protracted period of time or a considerable distance but within a single theatre of operations or delimited area a campaign may last only a few weeks but usually lasts several months or even
a military operation is the coordinated military actions of a state or a non state actor in response to a developing situation these actions are designed as a military plan to resolve the situation in the state s favor operations may be of a combat or non combat nature and are referred to by a code name for the purpose of national security military operations are often known for their more generally accepted common usage names than their actual operational objectives military operations can be classified by the scale and scope of force employment and their impact on the wider conflict the scope of military operations can be the operational level of war occupies roughly the middle ground between the campaign s strategic focus and the tactics of an engagement it describes a distinct intermediate level of war between military strategy governing war in general and tactics involving individual battles for example during world war ii the concept applied to use of soviet tank armies
network centric warfare also called network centric operations or net centric warfare is a military doctrine or theory of war pioneered by the united states department of defense in the s it seeks to translate an information advantage enabled in part by information technology into a competitive advantage through the robust computer networking of well informed geographically dispersed forces network centric warfare can trace its immediate origins to when admiral william owens introduced the concept of a system of systems in a paper of the same name published by the institute national security studies owens described the serendipitous evolution of a system of intelligence sensors command and control systems and precision weapons that enabled enhanced situational awareness rapid target assessment and distributed weapon assignment also in the joint chiefs of staff released joint vision which introduced the military concept of full spectrum dominance full spectrum dominance described the ability of the us military to dominate the battlespace from peace operations through to the outright application of military power that stemmed from the advantages of information superiority the term network centric warfare and associated concepts first appeared in the department of navy s publication copernicus c isr for the st century the ideas of networking sensors commanders and shooters to flatten the hierarchy reduce the operational pause enhance precision and increase speed of command were captured in this document as a distinct concept however network centric warfare first appeared publicly in a us naval institute proceedings article by vice admiral arthur k cebrowski and john garstka however the first complete articulation of the idea was contained in the book network centric warfare developing and leveraging information superiority by alberts garstka and stein published by the command and control research program ccrp this book derived a new theory of warfare from a
operations research or operational research in british usage is a discipline that deals with the application of advanced analytical methods to help make better decisions further the term operational analysis is used in the british and some british commonwealth military as an intrinsic part of capability development management and assurance in particular operational analysis forms part of the combined operational effectiveness and investment appraisals coeia which support british defence capability acquisition decision making it is often considered to be a sub field of mathematics the terms management science and decision science are sometimes used as synonyms employing techniques from other mathematical sciences such as mathematical modeling statistical analysis and mathematical optimization operations research arrives at optimal or near optimal solutions to complex decision making problems because of its emphasis on human technology interaction and because of its focus on practical applications operations research has overlap with other disciplines notably industrial engineering and operations management and draws on psychology and organization science operations research is often concerned with determining the maximum of profit performance or yield or minimum of loss risk or cost of some real world objective originating in military efforts before world war ii its techniques have grown to concern problems in a variety of industries operational research or encompasses a wide range of problem solving techniques and methods applied in the pursuit of improved decision making and efficiency such as simulation mathematical optimization queueing theory and other stochastic process models markov decision processes econometric methods data envelopment analysis neural networks expert systems decision analysis and the analytic hierarchy process nearly all of these techniques involve the construction of mathematical models that attempt to describe the system because of the computational and statistical nature of most of these fields or also has strong ties to computer science and analytics
the earliest known principles of war were documented by sun tzu circa bce machiavelli published his general rules in henri duke of rohan established his guides for war in marquis de silva presented his principles for war in henry lloyd proffered his version of rules for war in as well as his axioms for war in then in antoine henri jomini published his maxims for war version didactic resume and maxims for war version carl von clausewitz wrote his version in building on the work of earlier writers there are no agreed principles of war not even in the nato alliance although many of its members have their own the principles of war identified by carl von clausewitz in his essay principles of war and later enlarged in his book on war have been influential on military thinking in the north atlantic region additionally since their first appearance in english of the military maxims of napoleon in all english translations have relied upon the extremely incomplete french edition of general burnod published in citation needed this has contributed to the erroneous belief that napol on bonaparte had pioneered the principles of war napol on was a keen follower of famous military generals of the past who influenced his thoughts greatly albeit the armies of today are based on the organization created by napoleon sic for his grand army and it has been used ever since weider par since the mid th century due to the influence of the prussian army they have become a guide for many military organizations to focus the thinking of military commanders and political leaders toward concepts and methods of successful prosecution of wars and smaller military operations although originally concerned with strategy grand tactics and tactics due to the changing nature of warfare and military
a proxy war is a conflict between two nations where neither country directly engages the other while this can encompass a breadth of armed confrontation its core definition hinges on two separate powers utilizing external strife to somehow attack the interests or territorial holdings of the other this frequently involves both countries fighting their opponent s allies or assisting their allies in fighting their opponent proxy wars have been especially common since the close of world war ii and the rise of the cold war and were a defining aspect of global conflict during the latter half of the th century much of this was motivated by fears that direct conflict between the united states and soviet union would result in nuclear holocaust rendering proxy wars an ostensibly safer way of exercising hostilities there were also more immediate reasons for the emergence of proxy war on the global stage during its later years the ussr often found it less expensive to arm or otherwise prop up nato antagonistic parties in lieu of direct engagement in addition the proliferation of televised media and its impact on public perception made the u s public especially susceptible to war weariness and skeptical of risking american life abroad this led to the practice of arming insurgent forces such as the funneling of supplies to the mujahideen during the soviet afghan war proxy wars can also emerge from independent conflicts escalating due to the intervention of external powers for example the spanish civil war began as a civil war between the pro fascist revolutionary nationalists and supporters of the spanish republic called republicans however it evolved into a proxy war as nazi germany and its allies began supporting the nationalists while the ussr mexico and various international volunteers supported the republicans a significant disparity in
a religious war or holy war latin bellum sacrum is a war primarily caused or justified by differences in religion the account of the conquest of canaan by the israelites in the book of joshua the muslim conquests of the th and th centuries and the christian crusades th to th centuries and wars of religion th and th centuries are the classic examples but a religious aspect has been part of warfare as early as the battles of the mesopotamian city states in the modern era arguments are common over the extent to which religious economic or ethnic aspects of a conflict predominate examples include the yugoslav wars and the civil war in sudan in several ongoing conflicts including the israeli palestinian conflict the syrian civil war and the wars in afghanistan and iraq religious arguments are overtly present but variously described as fundamentalism or religious extremism depending upon the observer s sympathies the european war against muslim expansion was recognized as a religious war or bellum sacrum from the beginning the early modern wars against the ottoman empire were seen as a seamless continuation of this conflict by contemporaries the term religious war was used to describe controversially at the time what are now known as the european wars of religion and especially the then ongoing seven years war from at least the mid th century in their encyclopedia of wars authors charles phillips and alan axelrod attempt a comprehensive listing of wars in history they document wars overall of which have been identified and listed as primarily religiously motivated of these religious wars account for less than of all people killed in warfare this includes million during the crusades and during the inquisition the encyclopedia of war edited by gordon martel using the criteria that the armed
slavery is a legal or economic system in which principles of property law are applied to humans allowing them to be classified as property to be owned bought and sold accordingly and they cannot withdraw unilaterally from the arrangement while a person is a slave the owner is entitled to the productivity of the slave s labour without any remuneration the rights and protection of the slave may be regulated by laws and customs in a particular time and place and a person may become a slave from the time of their capture purchase or birth such slavery is commonly referred to as chattel slavery or traditional slavery it is the least prevalent form of slavery in the world today today chattel slavery is unlawful in all countries but a person may still be described as a slave if he or she is forced to work for another person without an ability on their part to unilaterally terminate the arrangement such situations are today commonly referred to as practices similar to slavery the present form of the slave trade is commonly referred to as human trafficking slavery existed before written history and in many cultures it was once institutionally recognized by most societies but has now been outlawed in all countries the last being mauritania in however it continues through such practices as debt bondage serfdom domestic servants kept in captivity certain adoptions in which children are forced to work as slaves child soldiers human trafficking and forced marriage accordingly there are still an estimated million to million slaves worldwide the english word slave comes from old french sclave from the medieval latin sclavus from the byzantine greek which in turn comes from the ethnonym slav because in some early medieval wars many slavs were captured and enslaved an older
in warfare a theater is an area or place in which important military events occur or are progressing a theater can include the entirety of the air space land and sea area that is or that may potentially become involved in war operations in his book on war carl von clausewitz defines the term as one that denotes properly such a portion of the space over which war prevails as has its boundaries protected and thus possesses a kind of independence this protection may consist in fortresses or important natural obstacles presented by the country or even in its being separated by a considerable distance from the rest of the space embraced in the war such a portion is not a mere piece of the whole but a small whole complete in itself and consequently it is more or less in such a condition that changes which take place at other points in the seat of war have only an indirect and no direct influence upon it to give an adequate idea of this we may suppose that on this portion an advance is made whilst in another quarter a retreat is taking place or that upon the one an army is acting defensively whilst an offensive is being carried on upon the other such a clearly defined idea as this is not capable of universal application it is here used merely to indicate the line of distinction theater of operations to is a sub area within a theater of war the boundary of a to is defined by the commander who is orchestrating or providing support for specific combat operations within the to theater of operations are divided into strategic directions or military regions depending whether it s a war or peace time the united states armed forces split
a war crime is an act that constitutes a serious violation of the law of war that gives rise to individual criminal responsibility examples of war crimes include intentionally killing civilians or prisoners torture wantonly destroying property taking hostages perfidy rape using child soldiers pillaging declaring that no quarter will be given and using weapons that cause superfluous injury or unnecessary suffering the concept of war crimes began to emerge during the end of the th century and the beginning of the th century when the body of customary international law applicable to warfare between sovereign states was codified such codification occurred at the national level such as with the publication of the lieber code in the united states and at the international level with the adoption of the treaties during the hague conventions of and moreover trials in national courts during this period further helped clarify the law following the end of world war ii major developments in the law occurred numerous trials of axis war criminals established the nuremberg principles such as notion that war crimes constituted crimes defined by international law additionally the geneva conventions in defined new war crimes and established that states could exercise universal jurisdiction over such crimes in the late th century and early st century following the creation of several international courts additional categories of war crimes applicable to armed conflicts other than those between states such as civil wars the united states israel and russia are the only oecd countries that do not accept war crime jurisdiction of the international criminal court icc over its nationals since they have not signed the rome statute the trial of peter von hagenbach by an ad hoc tribunal of the holy roman empire in was the first international war crimes trial and also of
war film is a film genre concerned with warfare typically about naval air or land battles in the twentieth century with combat scenes central to the drama the fateful nature of battle scenes means that war films often end with them themes explored include combat survival and escape sacrifice the futility and inhumanity of battle the effects of war on society and the moral and human issues raised by war war films are often categorized by their milieu such as the korean war the most popular subject is the second world war the stories told may be fiction historical drama or biographical critics have noted similarities between the western and the war film nations such as china indonesia russia and japan have their own traditions of war film centred on their own revolutionary wars but taking varied forms from action and historical drama to wartime romance subgenres not necessarily distinct include anti war comedy animated propaganda and documentary there are similarly subgenres of the war film in specific theatres such as the western desert north africa and the pacific in the second world war or films about vietnam and films set in specific domains of war such as the infantry the air at sea in submarines or prisoner of war camps the war film genre is not necessarily tightly defined the american film institute for example speaks of films to grapple with the great war without attempting to classify these however some directors and critics have offered at least tentative definitions the director sam fuller defined the genre by saying that a war film s objective no matter how personal or emotional is to make a viewer feel war john belton identified four narrative elements of the war film within the context of hollywood production a the suspension of civilian
a war novel military fiction is a novel in which the primary action takes place on a battlefield or in a civilian setting or home front where the characters are either preoccupied with the preparations for suffering the effects of or recovering from war many war novels are historical novels the war novel s origins are in the epic poetry of the classical and medieval periods especially homer s the iliad virgil s the aeneid sagas like the old english beowulf and arthurian literature all of these epics were concerned with preserving the history or mythology of conflicts between different societies while providing an accessible narrative that could reinforce the collective memory of a people other important influences on the war novel included the tragedies of dramatists such as euripides seneca the younger christopher marlowe and shakespeare euripedes the trojan women is a powerfully disturbing play on the theme of war s horrors apparently critical of athenian imperialism shakespeare s henry v which focuses on events immediately before and after the battle of agincourt during the hundred years war provides a model for how the history tactics and ethics of war could be combined in an essentially fictional framework romances and satires in early modern europe like edmund spenser s epic poem the faerie queene and miguel de cervantes s novel don quixote to name but two also contain elements that influenced the later development of war novels in terms of imagery and symbolism many modern war novels especially those espousing an anti war viewpoint are influenced by dante s depiction of hell in the the inferno john milton s account of the war in heaven in paradise lost and the apocalypse as depicted in the biblical book of revelation a notable non western example of war novel is luo
