- :release:`1.0.1 <2021-11-04>`
- :support:`-` Bugfix from version 1.0.0. Removed ``dist`` directory and
  built wheel again.

- :release:`1.0.0 <2021-11-02>`
- :support:`-` Minor update from version 0.0.3. ``scisample`` now supports 
  ``uqpipeline`` samplers if this package is available on your system. Some
  filenames were changed, which will affect users who import sampling classes
  directly instead of using the ``sampler`` interface.
