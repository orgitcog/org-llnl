time is a measure in which events can be ordered from the past through the present into the future and also the measure of durations of events and the intervals between them time is often referred to as the fourth dimension along with the three spatial dimensions time has long been a major subject of study in religion philosophy and science but defining it in a manner applicable to all fields without circularity has consistently eluded scholars nevertheless diverse fields such as business industry sports the sciences and the performing arts all incorporate some notion of time into their respective measuring systems some simple definitions of time include time is what clocks measure which is a problematically vague and self referential definition that utilizes the device used to measure the subject as the definition of the subject and time is what keeps everything from happening at once which is without substantive meaning in the absence of the definition of simultaneity in the context of the limitations of human sensation observation of events and the perception of such events two contrasting viewpoints on time divide many prominent philosophers one view is that time is part of the fundamental structure of the universe a dimension independent of events in which events occur in sequence sir isaac newton subscribed to this realist view and hence it is sometimes referred to as newtonian time the opposing view is that time does not refer to any kind of container that events and objects move through nor to any entity that flows but that it is instead part of a fundamental intellectual structure together with space and number within which humans sequence and compare events this second view in the tradition of gottfried leibniz and immanuel kant holds that time is neither an event nor a
in physics energy is a property of objects which can be transferred to other objects or converted into different forms but cannot be created or destroyed the ability of a system to perform work is a common description but it is difficult to give one single comprehensive definition of energy because of its many forms for instance in si units energy is measured in joules and one joule is defined mechanically being the energy transferred to an object by the mechanical work of moving it a distance of metre against a force of newton note however there are many other definitions of energy depending on the context such as thermal energy radiant energy electromagnetic nuclear etc where definitions are derived that are the most convenient common energy forms include the kinetic energy of a moving object the radiant energy carried by light the potential energy stored by an object s position in a force field gravitational electric or magnetic elastic energy stored by stretching solid objects chemical energy released when a fuel burns and the thermal energy due to an object s temperature all of the many forms of energy are convertible to other kinds of energy and obey the law of conservation of energy which says that energy can be neither created nor be destroyed however it can change from one form to another for closed systems with no external source or sink of energy the first law of thermodynamics states that a system s energy is constant unless energy is transferred in or out by mechanical work or heat and that no energy is lost in transfer this means that it is impossible to create or destroy energy the second law of thermodynamics states that all systems doing work always lose some energy as waste heat this creates
before the th century the term matter included ordinary matter composed of atoms and excluded other energy phenomena such as light or sound this concept of matter may be generalized from atoms to include any objects having mass even when at rest but this is ill defined because an object s mass can arise from its possibly massless constituents motion and interaction energies thus matter does not have a universal definition nor is it a fundamental concept in physics today matter is also used loosely as a general term for the substance that makes up all observable physical objects all the objects from everyday life that we can bump into touch or squeeze are composed of atoms this atomic matter is in turn made up of interacting subatomic particles usually a nucleus of protons and neutrons and a cloud of orbiting electrons typically science considers these composite particles matter because they have both rest mass and volume by contrast massless particles such as photons are not considered matter because they have neither rest mass nor volume however not all particles with rest mass have a classical volume since fundamental particles such as quarks and leptons sometimes equated with matter are considered point particles with no effective size or volume nevertheless quarks and leptons together make up ordinary matter and their interactions contribute to the effective volume of the composite particles that make up ordinary matter matter commonly exists in four states or phases solid liquid and gas and plasma however advances in experimental techniques have revealed other previously theoretical phases such as bose einstein condensates and fermionic condensates a focus on an elementary particle view of matter also leads to new phases of matter such as the quark gluon plasma for much of the history of the natural sciences people
finance is a field that deals with the study of investments which includes the dynamics of assets and liabilities over time under conditions of different degrees of uncertainty and risk finance can also be defined as the science of money management a key point in finance is the time value of money which states that purchasing power of one unit of currency can vary over time finance aims to price assets based on their risk level and their expected rate of return finance can be broken into three different sub categories public finance corporate finance and personal finance questions in personal finance revolve around personal finance may involve paying for education financing durable goods such as real estate and cars buying insurance e g health and property insurance investing and saving for retirement personal finance may also involve paying for a loan or debt obligations the six key areas of personal financial planning as suggested by the financial planning standards board are corporate finance deals with the sources of funding and the capital structure of corporations and the actions that managers take to increase the value of the firm to the shareholders as well as the tools and analysis used to allocate financial resources although it is in principle different from managerial finance which studies the financial management of all firms rather than corporations alone the main concepts in the study of corporate finance are applicable to the financial problems of all kinds of firms corporate finance generally involves balancing risk and profitability while attempting to maximize an entity s assets net incoming cash flow and the value of its stock and generically entails three primary areas of capital resource allocation in the first capital budgeting management must choose which projects if any to undertake the discipline of capital budgeting

in probability theory and intertemporal portfolio choice the kelly criterion kelly strategy kelly formula or kelly bet is a formula used to determine the optimal size of a series of bets in most gambling scenarios and some investing scenarios under some simplifying assumptions the kelly strategy will do better than any essentially different strategy in the long run that is over a span of time in which the observed fraction of bets that are successful equals the probability that any given bet will be successful it was described by j l kelly jr in the practical use of the formula has been demonstrated although the kelly strategy s promise of doing better than any other strategy in the long run seems compelling some economists have argued strenuously against it mainly because an individual s specific investing constraints may override the desire for optimal growth rate the conventional alternative is expected utility theory which says bets should be sized to maximize the expected utility of the outcome to an individual with logarithmic utility the kelly bet maximizes expected utility so there is no conflict moreover kelly s original paper clearly states the need for a utility function in the case of gambling games which are played finitely many times even kelly supporters usually argue for fractional kelly betting a fixed fraction of the amount recommended by kelly for a variety of practical reasons such as wishing to reduce volatility or protecting against non deterministic errors in their advantage edge calculations in recent years kelly has become a part of mainstream investment theory and the claim has been made that well known successful investors including warren buffett and bill gross use kelly methods william poundstone wrote an extensive popular account of the history of kelly betting for simple bets with two outcomes
market timing is the strategy of making buy or sell decisions of financial assets often stocks by attempting to predict future market price movements the prediction may be based on an outlook of market or economic conditions resulting from technical or fundamental analysis this is an investment strategy based on the outlook for an aggregate market rather than for a particular financial asset whether market timing is ever a viable investment strategy is controversial some may consider market timing to be a form of gambling based on pure chance because they do not believe in undervalued or overvalued markets the efficient market hypothesis claims that financial prices always exhibit random walk behavior and thus cannot be predicted with consistency some consider market timing to be sensible in certain situations such as an apparent bubble however because the economy is a complex system that contains many factors even at times of significant market optimism or pessimism it remains difficult if not impossible to predetermine the local maximum or minimum of future prices with any precision a so called bubble can last for many years before prices collapse likewise a crash can persist for extended periods stocks that appear to be cheap at a glance can often become much cheaper afterwards before then either rebounding at some time in the future or heading toward bankruptcy proponents of market timing counter that market timing is just another name for trading they argue that attempting to predict future market price movements is what all traders do regardless of whether they trade individual stocks or collections of stocks aka mutual funds thus if market timing is not a viable investment strategy the proponents say then neither is any of the trading on the various stock exchanges those who disagree with this view usually advocate a

macroeconomics from the greek prefix makro meaning large and economics is a branch of economics dealing with the performance structure behavior and decision making of an economy as a whole rather than individual markets this includes national regional and global economies with microeconomics macroeconomics is one of the two most general fields in economics macroeconomists study aggregated indicators such as gdp unemployment rates and price indices and the interrelations among the different sectors of the economy to better understand how the whole economy functions macroeconomists develop models that explain the relationship between such factors as national income output consumption unemployment inflation savings investment international trade and international finance in contrast microeconomics is primarily focused on the actions of individual agents such as firms and consumers and how their behavior determines prices and quantities in specific markets while macroeconomics is a broad field of study there are two areas of research that are emblematic of the discipline the attempt to understand the causes and consequences of short run fluctuations in national income the business cycle and the attempt to understand the determinants of long run economic growth increases in national income macroeconomic models and their forecasts are used by governments to assist in the development and evaluation of economic policy macroeconomics encompasses a variety of concepts and variables but there are three central topics for macroeconomic research macroeconomic theories usually relate the phenomena of output unemployment and inflation outside of macroeconomic theory these topics are also important to all economic agents including workers consumers and producers national output is the total amount of everything a country produces in a given time period everything that is produced and sold generates an equal amount of income therefore output and income are usually considered equivalent and the two terms are often used interchangeably output
in economics adaptive expectations is a hypothesized process by which people form their expectations about what will happen in the future based on what has happened in the past for example if inflation has been higher than expected in the past people would revise expectations for the future one simple version of adaptive expectations is stated in the following equation where is the next year s rate of inflation that is currently expected is this year s rate of inflation that was expected last year and is this year s actual rate of inflation where is between and this says that current expectations of future inflation reflect past expectations and an error adjustment term in which current expectations are raised or lowered according to the gap between actual inflation and previous expectations this error adjustment is also called partial adjustment the theory of adaptive expectations can be applied to all previous periods so that current inflationary expectations equal where equals actual inflation years in the past thus current expected inflation reflects a weighted average of all past inflation where the weights get smaller and smaller as we move further in the past once a forecasting error is made by agents due to a stochastic shock they will be unable to correctly forecast the price level again even if the price level experiences no further shocks since they only ever incorporate part of their errors the backward nature of expectation formulation and the resultant systematic errors made by agents see cobweb model was unsatisfactory to economists such as john muth who was pivotal in the development of an alternative model of how expectations are formed called rational expectations this has largely replaced adaptive expectations in macroeconomic theory since its assumption of optimality of expectations is consistent with economic theory however it
in macroeconomics aggregate demand ad or domestic final demand dfd is the total demand for final goods and services in an economy at a given time it specifies the amounts of goods and services that will be purchased at all possible price levels this is the demand for the gross domestic product of a country it is often called effective demand though at other times this term is distinguished the aggregate demand curve is plotted with real output on the horizontal axis and the price level on the vertical axis it is downward sloping as a result of three distinct effects pigou s wealth effect keynes interest rate effect and the mundell fleming exchange rate effect the pigou effect states that a higher price level implies lower real wealth and therefore lower consumption spending giving a lower quantity of goods demanded in the aggregate the keynes effect states that a higher price level implies a lower real money supply and therefore higher interest rates resulting from financial market equilibrium in turn resulting in lower investment spending on new physical capital and hence a lower quantity of goods being demanded in the aggregate the aggregate demand curve illustrates the relationship between two factors the quantity of output that is demanded and the aggregate price level aggregate demand is expressed contingent upon a fixed level of the nominal money supply there are many factors that can shift the ad curve rightward shifts result from increases in the money supply in government expenditure or in autonomous components of investment or consumption spending or from decreases in taxes according to the aggregate demand aggregate supply model when aggregate demand increases there is movement up along the aggregate supply curve giving a higher level of prices john maynard keynes in the general theory of employment
the balance of payments also known as balance of international payments and abbreviated bp of a country is the record of all economic transactions between the residents of the country and the rest of the world in a particular period over a quarter of a year or more commonly over a year these transactions are made by individuals firms and government bodies thus the balance of payments includes all external visible and non visible transactions of a country it represents a summation of country s current demand and supply of the claims on foreign currencies and of foreign claims on its currency these transactions include payments for the country s exports and imports of goods services financial capital and financial transfers it is prepared in a single currency typically the domestic currency for the country concerned sources of funds for a nation such as exports or the receipts of loans and investments are recorded as positive or surplus items uses of funds such as for imports or to invest in foreign countries are recorded as negative or deficit items when all components of the bop accounts are included they must sum to zero with no overall surplus or deficit for example if a country is importing more than it exports its trade balance will be in deficit but the shortfall will have to be counterbalanced in other ways such as by funds earned from its foreign investments by running down central bank reserves or by receiving loans from other countries while the overall bop accounts will always balance when all types of payments are included imbalances are possible on individual elements of the bop such as the current account the capital account excluding the central bank s reserve account or the sum of the two imbalances in the latter sum
the business cycle or economic cycle is the downward and upward movement of gross domestic product gdp around its long term growth trend these fluctuations typically involve shifts over time between periods of relatively rapid economic growth expansions or booms and periods of relative stagnation or decline contractions or recessions used in the indefinite sense a business cycle is a period of time containing a single boom and contraction in sequence business cycles are usually measured by considering the growth rate of real gross domestic product despite being termed cycles these fluctuations in economic activity can prove unpredictable a boom and bust cycle is one in which the expansions are rapid and the contractions are steep and severe the first systematic exposition of periodic economic crises in opposition to the existing theory of economic equilibrium was the nouveaux principes d conomie politique by jean charles l onard de sismondi prior to that point classical economics had either denied the existence of business cycles blamed them on external factors notably war or only studied the long term sismondi found vindication in the panic of which was the first unarguably international economic crisis occurring in peacetime sismondi and his contemporary robert owen who expressed similar but less systematic thoughts in report to the committee of the association for the relief of the manufacturing poor both identified the cause of economic cycles as overproduction and underconsumption caused in particular by wealth inequality they advocated government intervention and socialism respectively as the solution this work did not generate interest among classical economists though underconsumption theory developed as a heterodox branch in economics until being systematized in keynesian economics in the s sismondi s theory of periodic crises was developed into a theory of alternating cycles by charles dunoyer and similar theories showing signs of
capacity utilization or capacity utilisation is the extent to which an enterprise or a nation actually uses its installed productive capacity it is the relationship between output that is actually produced with the installed equipment and the potential output which could be produced with it if capacity was fully used one of the most used definitions of the capacity utilization rate is the ratio of actual output to the potential output but potential output can be defined in at least two different ways one is the engineering or technical definition according to which potential output represents the maximum amount of output that can be produced in the short run with the existent stock of capital thus a standard definition of capacity utilization is the weighted average of the ratios between the actual output of firms to the maximum that could be produced per unit of time with existing plant and equipment see johanson obviously output could be measured in physical units or in market values but normally it is measured in market values however as output increases and well before the absolute physical limit of production is reached most firms might well experience an increase in the average cost of production even if there is no change in the level of plant equipment used for example higher average costs can arise because of the need to operate extra shifts to undertake additional plant maintenance and so on an alternative approach sometimes called the economic utilization rate is therefore to measure the ratio of actual output to the level of output beyond which the average cost of production begins to rise in this case surveyed firms are asked by how much it would be practicable for them to raise production from existing plant and equipment without raising unit costs see berndt
capital flight in economics occurs when assets or money rapidly flow out of a country due to an event of economic consequence such events could be an increase in taxes on capital or capital holders or the government of the country defaulting on its debt that disturbs investors and causes them to lower their valuation of the assets in that country or otherwise to lose confidence in its economic strength this leads to a disappearance of wealth and is usually accompanied by a sharp drop in the exchange rate of the affected country depreciation in a variable exchange rate regime or a forced devaluation in a fixed exchange rate regime this fall is particularly damaging when the capital belongs to the people of the affected country because not only are the citizens now burdened by the loss of faith in the economy and devaluation of their currency but probably also their assets have lost much of their nominal value this leads to dramatic decreases in the purchasing power of the country s assets and makes it increasingly expensive to import goods capital flight may be legal or illegal under domestic law legal capital flight is recorded on the books of the entity or individual making the transfer and earnings from interest dividends and realized capital gains normally return to the country of origin illegal capital flight also known as illicit financial flows is intended to disappear from any record in the country of origin and earnings on the stock of illegal capital flight outside of a country generally do not return to the country of origin capital flight is also sometimes used to refer to the removal of wealth and assets from a city or region within a country post apartheid south african cities are probably the most visible example
a central bank reserve bank or monetary authority is an institution that manages a state s currency money supply and interest rates central banks also usually oversee the commercial banking system of their respective countries in contrast to a commercial bank a central bank possesses a monopoly on increasing the monetary base in the state and usually also prints the national currency which usually serves as the state s legal tender the primary function of a central bank is to control the nation s money supply monetary policy through active duties such as managing interest rates setting the reserve requirement and acting as a lender of last resort to the banking sector during times of bank insolvency or financial crisis central banks usually also have supervisory powers intended to prevent bank runs and to reduce the risk that commercial banks and other financial institutions engage in reckless or fraudulent behavior central banks in most developed nations are institutionally designed to be independent from political interference still limited control by the executive and legislative bodies usually exists prior to the th century most money was commodity money typically gold or silver however promises to pay were widely circulated and accepted as value at least five hundred years earlier in both europe and asia the song dynasty was the first to issue generally circulating paper currency while the yuan dynasty was the first to use notes as the predominant circulating medium in in an effort to control inflation the succeeding ming dynasty ended the use of paper money and closed much of chinese trade the medieval european knights templar ran an early prototype of a central banking system as their promises to pay were widely respected and many regard their activities as having laid the basis for the modern banking system as
consumer confidence is an economic indicator that measures the degree of optimism that consumers feel about the overall state of the economy and their personal financial situation how confident people feel about the stability of their incomes affects their economic decisions such as spending activity and therefore consumer confidence serves as one of the key indicators of the overall shape of the economy in essence if consumer confidence is high consumers will be making more purchases on the other hand if confidence is low consumers tend to save more and spend less a month to month trend in consumer confidence reflects the outlook of consumers with respect to their ability to find and retain good jobs according to their perception of the current state of the economy and their personal financial situation consumer confidence typically increases when the economy expands and decreases when the economy contracts however this does not necessarily follow since consumers may not have perfect information on the situation of the economy in the united states there is evidence that the measure is a lagging indicator of stock market performance investors manufacturers retailers banks and government agencies use various assessments of consumer confidence in planning their actions the ability to predict major changes in consumer confidence allows businesses to gauge the willingness of consumers to make new purchases as a result businesses can adjust their operations and the government can prepare for changing tax revenue if confidence is dropping and consumers are expected to reduce their spending most producers will tend to reduce their production volumes accordingly for example if manufacturers anticipate consumers will reduce retail purchases especially for expensive and durable goods they will cut down their inventories in advance and may delay investing in new projects and facilities similarly if banks expect consumers to decrease
a currency from middle english curraunt in circulation from latin currens entis in the most specific use of the word refers to money in any form when in actual use or circulation as a medium of exchange especially circulating banknotes and coins a more general definition is that a currency is a system of money monetary units in common use especially in a nation under this definition british pounds u s dollars and european euros are examples of currency these various currencies are stores of value and are traded between nations in foreign exchange markets which determine the relative values of the different currencies currencies in this sense are defined by governments and each type has limited boundaries of acceptance other definitions of the term currency are discussed in their respective synonymous articles banknote coin and money the latter definition pertaining to the currency systems of nations is the topic of this article currencies can be classified into two monetary systems fiat money and commodity money depending on what guarantees the value the economy at large vs the government s physical metal reserves some currencies are legal tender in certain jurisdictions which means they cannot be refused as payment for debt others are simply traded for their economic value digital currency arose with the popularity of computers and the internet currency evolved from two basic innovations both of which had occurred by bc originally money was a form of receipt representing grain stored in temple granaries in sumer in ancient mesopotamia then ancient egypt in this first stage of currency metals were used as symbols to represent value stored in the form of commodities this formed the basis of trade in the fertile crescent for over years however the collapse of the near eastern trading system pointed to a flaw
in economics a demand shock is a sudden event that increases or decreases demand for goods or services temporarily a positive demand shock increases demand and a negative demand shock decreases demand prices of goods and services are affected in both cases when demand for a good or service increases its price typically increases because of a shift in the demand curve to the right when demand decreases its price typically decreases because of a shift in the demand curve to the left demand shocks can originate from changes in things such as tax rates money supply and government spending for example taxpayers owe the government less money after a tax cut thereby freeing up more money available for personal spending when the taxpayers use the money to purchase goods and services their prices go up in the midst of a poor economic situation in the united kingdom in november the bank of england s deputy governor mervyn king warned that the domestic economy was sufficiently imbalanced that it ran the risk of causing a large negative demand shock in the near future at the london school of economics he elaborated by saying beneath the surface of overall stability in the uk economy lies a remarkable imbalance between a buoyant consumer and housing sector on the one hand and weak external demand on the other during the global financial crisis of a negative demand shock in the united states economy was caused by several factors that included falling house prices the subprime mortgage crisis and lost household wealth which led to a drop in consumer spending to counter this negative demand shock the federal reserve system lowered interest rates before the crisis occurred the world s economy experienced a positive global supply shock immediately afterward however a positive global demand
dynamic stochastic general equilibrium modeling abbreviated dsge or sometimes sdge or dge is a branch of applied general equilibrium theory that is influential in contemporary macroeconomics the dsge methodology attempts to explain aggregate economic phenomena such as economic growth business cycles and the effects of monetary and fiscal policy on the basis of macroeconomic models derived from microeconomic principles while traditional macroeconometric forecasting models are vulnerable to the lucas critique that claim that the effects of an economic policy cannot be predicted using historical data from a period when that policy was not in place microfounded models should not be at least in theory further since the microfoundations are based on the preferences of the decision makers in the model dsge models feature a natural benchmark for evaluating the welfare effects of policy changes for discussion of both points see woodford pp and tovar pp like other general equilibrium models in economics dsge models aim to describe the behavior of the economy as a whole by analyzing the interaction of many microeconomic decisions the decisions considered in most dsge models correspond to some of the main quantities studied in macroeconomics such as consumption saving investment and labor supply and labor demand the decision makers in the model often called agents may include households business firms and possibly others such as governments or central banks furthermore as their name indicates dsge models are dynamic studying how the economy evolves over time they are also stochastic taking into account the fact that the economy is affected by random shocks such as technological change fluctuations in the price of oil or changes in macroeconomic policy making this contrasts with the static models studied in walrasian general equilibrium theory applied general equilibrium models and some computable general equilibrium models for a coherent description of
economic growth is the increase in the inflation adjusted market value of the goods and services produced by an economy over time it is conventionally measured as the percent rate of increase in real gross domestic product or real gdp of more importance is the growth of the ratio of gdp to population gdp per capita which is also called per capita income an increase in growth caused by more efficient use of inputs such as physical capital population or territory is referred to as intensive growth gdp growth caused only by increases in the amount of inputs available for use is called extensive growth in economics economic growth or economic growth theory typically refers to growth of potential output i e production at full employment as an area of study economic growth is generally distinguished from development economics the former is primarily the study of how countries can advance their economies the latter is the study of the economic development process particularly in low income countries growth is usually calculated in real terms i e inflation adjusted terms to eliminate the distorting effect of inflation on the price of goods produced measurement of economic growth uses national income accounting since economic growth is measured as the annual percent change of gross domestic product gdp it has all the advantages and drawbacks of that measure economic growth is generally calculated from data on gdp and population provided by countries statistical agencies although independent scholarly estimates are also available over long periods of time even small rates of growth such as a annual increase have large effects for example the united kingdom experienced a average annual increase in its inflation adjusted gdp between and in the gdp was million pounds it grew to million pounds by a growth rate that averaged
an economic indicator is a statistic about an economic activity economic indicators allow analysis of economic performance and predictions of future performance one application of economic indicators is the study of business cycles economic indicators include various indices earnings reports and economic summaries examples unemployment rate quits rate quit rate in u s english housing starts consumer price index a measure for inflation consumer leverage ratio industrial production bankruptcies gross domestic product broadband internet penetration retail sales stock market prices money supply changes the leading business cycle dating committee in the united states of america is the national bureau of economic research private the bureau of labor statistics is the principal fact finding agency for the u s government in the field of labor economics and statistics other producers of economic indicators includes the united states census bureau and united states bureau of economic analysis economic indicators can be classified into three categories according to their usual timing in relation to the business cycle leading indicators lagging indicators and coincident indicators leading indicators are indicators that usually but not always change before the economy as a whole changes they are therefore useful as short term predictors of the economy stock market returns are a leading indicator the stock market usually begins to decline before the economy as a whole declines and usually begins to improve before the general economy begins to recover from a slump other leading indicators include the index of consumer expectations building permits and the money supply the conference board publishes a composite leading economic index consisting of ten indicators designed to predict activity in the u s economy six to nine months in future components of the conference board s leading economic indicators index lagging indicators are indicators that usually change after the economy as a
in economics effective demand ed in a market is the demand for a product or service which occurs when purchasers are constrained in a different market it contrasts with national demand which is the demand that occurs when purchasers are not constrained in any other market in the aggregated market for goods in general effective demand is the same thing as aggregate demand when the demand for goods is influenced by spillovers from quantity constraints from other markets the concept of effective supply parallels the concept of effective demand the concept of effective demand or supply becomes relevant when markets do not continuously maintain equilibrium prices one example involves spillovers from the labor market to the goods market if there is labour market disequilibrium such that individuals cannot supply all the labor they want to supply then the amount that they are able to supply will influence their demand for goods the demand for goods contingent on the constraint on the amount of labor that can be supplied is their effective demand for goods in contrast if there were no labor market disequilibrium individuals would simultaneously choose both their quantity of labor to supply and the quantity of goods to purchase and the latter would be their notional demand for goods in this example the effective demand for goods would be less than the notional demand for goods conversely if there are goods market shortages individuals may choose to supply less labor and enjoy more leisure than they would in the absence of goods market disequilibrium the amount of labor they choose to supply contingent on the constraint on the amount of goods they can buy is the effective supply of labor another example involves spillovers from credit markets to the goods market if there is credit rationing some individuals
the general theory of employment interest and money was written by the english economist john maynard keynes the book generally considered to be his magnum opus is largely credited with creating the terminology and shape of modern macroeconomics published in february it sought to bring about a revolution commonly referred to as the keynesian revolution in the way economists thought especially in relation to the proposition that a market economy tends naturally to restore itself to full employment after temporary shocks regarded widely as the cornerstone of keynesian thought the book challenged the established classical economics and introduced important concepts such as the consumption function the multiplier the marginal efficiency of capital the principle of effective demand and liquidity preference the central argument of the general theory is that the level of employment is determined not by the price of labour as in neoclassical economics but by the spending of money aggregate demand keynes argues that it is wrong to assume that competitive markets will in the long run deliver full employment or that full employment is the natural self righting equilibrium state of a monetary economy on the contrary under employment and under investment are likely to be the natural state unless active measures are taken one implication of the general theory is that an absence of competition is not the main issue regarding unemployment and that even reducing wages or benefits has no major effect keynes sought to do nothing less but upend the conventional economic wisdom he mailed a letter to his friend george bernard shaw on new year s day i believe myself to be writing a book on economic theory which will largely revolutionize not i suppose at once but in the course of the next ten years the way the world thinks about its
the great depression was a severe worldwide economic depression that took place during the s the timing of the great depression varied across nations however in most countries it started in and lasted until the late s it was the longest deepest and most widespread depression of the th century in the st century the great depression is commonly used as an example of how far the world s economy can decline the depression originated in the united states after a fall in stock prices that began around september and became worldwide news with the stock market crash of october known as black tuesday between and worldwide gdp fell by an estimated by comparison worldwide gdp fell by less than from to during the great recession some economies started to recover by the mid s however in many countries the negative effects of the great depression lasted until the beginning of world war ii the great depression had devastating effects in countries both rich and poor personal income tax revenue profits and prices dropped while international trade plunged by more than unemployment in the u s rose to and in some countries rose as high as cities all around the world were hit hard especially those dependent on heavy industry construction was virtually halted in many countries farming communities and rural areas suffered as crop prices fell by approximately facing plummeting demand with few alternate sources of jobs areas dependent on primary sector industries such as mining and logging suffered the most economic historians usually attribute the start of the great depression to the sudden devastating collapse of us stock market prices on october known as black tuesday however some dispute this conclusion and see the stock crash as a symptom rather than a cause of the great depression even
in economics hyperinflation occurs when a country experiences very high and usually accelerating rates of inflation rapidly eroding the real value of the local currency and causing the population to minimize their holdings of the local money the population normally switches to holding relatively stable foreign currencies under such conditions the general price level within an economy increases rapidly as the official currency quickly loses real value the value of economic items remains relatively more stable in terms of foreign currencies unlike low inflation where the process of rising prices is protracted and not generally noticeable except by studying past market prices hyperinflation sees a rapid and continuing increase in nominal prices and in the supply of money and the nominal cost of goods but typically the general price level rises even more rapidly than the money supply since people try to get rid of the devaluing money as quickly as possible the real stock of money that is the amount of circulating money divided by the price level decreases hyperinflations are usually caused by large persistent government deficits financed primarily by money creation rather than taxation or borrowing as such hyperinflation is often associated with wars their aftermath sociopolitical upheavals or other crises that make it difficult for the government to tax the population a sharp decrease in real tax revenue coupled with a strong need to maintain the status quo together with an inability or unwillingness to borrow can lead a country into hyperinflation in phillip cagan wrote the monetary dynamics of hyperinflation the book often regarded as the first serious study of hyperinflation and its effects though the economics of inflation by c bresciani turroni on the german hyperinflation was published in italian in citation needed in his book cagan defined a hyperinflationary episode as starting in
an interest rate is the rate at which interest is paid by borrowers debtors for the use of money that they borrow from lenders creditors specifically the interest rate is a percentage of principal paid a certain number of times per period for all periods during the total term of the loan or credit interest rates are normally expressed as a percentage of the principal for a period of one year sometimes they are expressed for different periods such as a month or a day different interest rates exist parallelly for the same or comparable time periods depending on the default probability of the borrower the residual term the payback currency and many more determinants of a loan or credit for example a company borrows capital from a bank to buy new assets for its business and in return the lender receives rights on the new assets as collateral and interest at a predetermined interest rate for deferring the use of funds and instead lending it to the borrower interest rate targets are a vital tool of monetary policy and are taken into account when dealing with variables like investment inflation and unemployment the central banks of countries generally tend to reduce interest rates when they wish to increase investment and consumption in the country s economy however a low interest rate as a macro economic policy can be risky and may lead to the creation of an economic bubble in which large amounts of investments are poured into the real estate market and stock market in developed economies interest rate adjustments are thus made to keep inflation within a target range for the health of economic activities or cap the interest rate concurrently with economic growth to safeguard economic momentum what is commonly referred to as the interest rate
the is lm model or hicks hansen model is a macroeconomic tool that shows the relationship between interest rates and real output in the goods and services market and the money market also known as the assets market the intersection of the investment saving is and liquidity preference money supply lm curves is the general equilibrium where there is simultaneous equilibrium in both markets two equivalent interpretations are possible first the is lm model explains changes in national income when the price level is fixed in the short run second the is lm model shows why the aggregate demand curve shifts hence this tool is sometimes used not only to analyse the fluctuations of the economy but also to find appropriate stabilisation policies the model was developed by john hicks in and later extended by alvin hansen as a mathematical representation of keynesian macroeconomic theory between the s and mid s it was the leading framework of macroeconomic analysis while it has been largely absent from macroeconomic research ever since it is still the backbone of many introductory macroeconomics textbooks the is lm model was born at the econometric conference held in oxford during september roy harrod john r hicks and james meade all presented papers describing mathematical models attempting to summarize john maynard keynes general theory of employment interest and money hicks who had seen a draft of harrod s paper invented the is lm model originally using the abbreviation ll not lm he later presented it in mr keynes and the classics a suggested interpretation hicks later agreed that the model missed important points of keynesian theory criticizing it as having very limited use beyond a classroom gadget and criticizing equilibrium methods generally when one turns to questions of policy looking towards the future instead of the past
