running is a method of terrestrial locomotion allowing humans and other animals to move rapidly on foot running is a type of gait characterized by an aerial phase in which all feet are above the ground though there are exceptions this is in contrast to walking where one foot is always in contact with the ground the legs are kept mostly straight and the center of gravity vaults over the stance leg or legs in an inverted pendulum fashion a characteristic feature of a running body from the viewpoint of spring mass mechanics is that changes in kinetic and potential energy within a stride occur simultaneously with energy storage accomplished by springy tendons and passive muscle elasticity the term running can refer to any of a variety of speeds ranging from jogging to sprinting it is assumed that the ancestors of mankind developed the ability to run for long distances about million years ago probably in order to hunt animals competitive running grew out of religious festivals in various areas records of competitive racing date back to the tailteann games in ireland in bce citation needed while the first recorded olympic games took place in bce running has been described as the world s most accessible sport it is thought that human running evolved at least four and a half million years ago out of the ability of the ape like australopithecus an early ancestor of humans to walk upright on two legs the theory proposed considered to be the most likely evolution of running is of early humans developing as endurance runners from the practice of persistence hunting of animals the activity of following and chasing until a prey is too exhausted to flee succumbing to chase myopathy sears and that human features such as the nuchal ligament abundant
jumping or leaping is a form of locomotion or movement in which an organism or non living e g robotic mechanical system propels itself through the air along a ballistic trajectory jumping can be distinguished from running galloping and other gaits where the entire body is temporarily airborne by the relatively long duration of the aerial phase and high angle of initial launch some animals such as the kangaroo employ jumping commonly called hopping in this instance as their primary form of locomotion while others such as frogs use it only as a means to escape predators jumping is also a key feature of various activities and sports including the long jump high jump and show jumping all jumping involves the application of force against a substrate which in turn generates a reactive force that propels the jumper away from the substrate any solid or liquid capable of producing an opposing force can serve as a substrate including ground or water examples of the latter include dolphins performing traveling jumps and indian skitter frogs executing standing jumps from water jumping organisms are rarely subject to significant aerodynamic forces and as a result their jumps are governed by the basic physical laws of ballistic trajectories consequently while a bird may jump into the air to initiate flight no movement it performs once airborne is considered jumping as the initial jump conditions no longer dictate its flight path following the moment of launch i e initial loss of contact with the substrate a jumper will traverse a parabolic path the launch angle and initial launch velocity determine the travel distance duration and height of the jump the maximum possible horizontal travel distance occurs at a launch angle of degrees but any launch angle between and degrees will result in ninety percent of
pole vaulting is a track and field event in which a person uses a long flexible pole which today is usually made either of fiberglass or carbon fiber as an aid to jump over a bar pole jumping competitions were known to the ancient greeks cretans and celts it has been a full medal event at the olympic games since for men and for women it is typically classified as one of the four major jumping events in athletics alongside the high jump long jump and triple jump it is unusual among track and field sports in that it requires a significant amount of specialised equipment in order to participate even at a basic level a number of elite pole vaulters have had backgrounds in gymnastics including world record breakers yelena isinbayeva and brian sternberg reflecting the similar physical attributes required for the sports running speed however may be the most important skill required poles were used as a practical means of passing over natural obstacles in marshy places such as provinces of friesland in the netherlands along the north sea and the great level of the fens across cambridgeshire huntingdonshire lincolnshire and norfolk artificial draining of these marshes created a network of open drains or canals intersecting each other to cross these without getting wet while avoiding tedious roundabout journeys over bridges a stack of jumping poles was kept at every house and used for vaulting over the canals venetian gondoliers have traditionally used punting poles for moving to the shore from their boat distance pole vaulting competitions continue to be held annually in the lowlands around the north sea these far jumping competitions frysk fierljeppen are not based on height one of the earliest pole vaulting competitions where height was measured took place at the ulverston football and

carbon fiber reinforced polymer carbon fiber reinforced plastic or carbon fiber reinforced thermoplastic cfrp crp cfrtp or often simply carbon fiber or even carbon is an extremely strong and light fiber reinforced plastic which contains carbon fibers the spelling fibre is common in british commonwealth countries cfrps can be expensive to produce but are commonly used wherever high strength to weight ratio and rigidity are required such as aerospace automotive and civil engineering sports goods and an increasing number of other consumer and technical applications the binding polymer is often a thermoset resin such as epoxy but other thermoset or thermoplastic polymers such as polyester vinyl ester or nylon are sometimes used the composite may contain other fibers such as an aramid e g kevlar twaron aluminium ultra high molecular weight polyethylene uhmwpe or glass fibers as well as carbon fiber the properties of the final cfrp product can also be affected by the type of additives introduced to the binding matrix the resin the most frequent additive is silica but other additives such as rubber and carbon nanotubes can be used the material is also referred to as graphite reinforced polymer or graphite fiber reinforced polymer gfrp is less common as it clashes with glass fiber reinforced polymer in product advertisements it is sometimes referred to simply as graphite fiber for short citation needed carbon fiber reinforced polymers are composite materials in this case the composite consists of two parts a matrix and a reinforcement in cfrp the reinforcement is carbon fiber which provides the strength the matrix is usually a polymer resin such as epoxy to bind the reinforcements together because cfrp consists of two distinct elements the material properties depend on these two elements the reinforcement will give the cfrp its strength and rigidity measured by stress
