gender identity is one s personal experience of one s own gender all societies have a set of gender categories that can serve as the basis of the formation of a person s social identity in relation to other members of society in most societies there is a basic division between gender attributes assigned to males and females a gender binary to which most people adhere and which enforces conformance to ideals of masculinity and femininity in all aspects of sex and gender biological sex gender identity and gender expression in all societies some individuals do not identify with some or all of the aspects of gender that are assigned to their biological sex some of those individuals are transgender or genderqueer some societies have third gender categories core gender identity is usually firmly formed by age three after age three it is extremely difficult to change and attempts to reassign it can result in gender dysphoria both biological and social factors have been suggested to influence its formation there are several theories about how and when gender identity forms and studying the subject is difficult because children s lack of language requires researchers to make assumptions from indirect evidence john money suggested children might have awareness of and attach some significance to gender as early as months to two years lawrence kohlberg argues that gender identity does not form until age three it is widely agreed that core gender identity is firmly formed by age three at this point children can make firm statements about their gender and tend to choose activities and toys which are considered appropriate for their gender such as dolls and painting for girls and tools and rough housing for boys although they do not yet fully understand the implications of gender after age three
 sportsmanship is an aspiration or ethos that a sport or activity will be enjoyed for its own sake with proper consideration for fairness ethics respect and a sense of fellowship with one s competitors a sore loser refers to one who does not take defeat well whereas a good sport means being a good winner as well as being a good loser sportsmanship can be conceptualized as an enduring and relatively stable characteristic or disposition such that individuals differ in the way they are generally expected to behave in sport situations in general sportsmanship refers to virtues such as fairness self control courage and persistence and has been associated with interpersonal concepts of treating others and being treated fairly maintaining self control if dealing with others and respect for both authority and opponents sportsmanship is also looked at as being the way one reacts to a sport game player the four elements of sportsmanship are often shown being good form the will to win willing to lose equity and fairness all four elements are critical and a balance must be found amongst all four for true sportsmanship to be illustrated these elements may also cause conflict as a person may desire to win more than play in equity and fairness and thus resulting in a clash within the aspects of sportsmanship this will cause problems as the person believes they are being a good sportsman but they are defeating the purpose of this idea as they are ignoring two key components of being sportsman like when athletes become too self centred the idea of sportsmanship unfortunately is dismissed today s sporting culture in particular the base of elite sport places great importance on the idea of competition and winning and thus sportsmanship takes a back seat as a result
