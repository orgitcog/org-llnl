                                 Version 1.4.5

================================================================================
This is a package containing three MPI benchmarks intended for use during
LLNL system procurement.

Each of the three benchmarks in located in a separate directory and includes
a README file describing the benchmark.

For point-to-point bandwidth and latency benchmarks, please see the presta/com
benchmark.

For messaging rate, please see the sqmr benchmark.

For collective latencies, please see the mpiBench benchmark.

The benchmarks should be built by modifying the top-level Makefile.inc file
to provide the appropriate compiler, linker, and flags and running 'make'.

Please send questions or comments to Chris Chambreau (chambreau1@llnl.gov).
