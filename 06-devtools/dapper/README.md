# DAPper

DAPper helps identify the software packages installed on a system, and expose implicit dependencies in source code.

The main tool for end users parses source code to determine packages that a C/C++ codebase depends on.
In addition, datasets mapping file names to packages that install them for various ecosystems are provided.
The tools used to create those datasets are also available in this repository.

## Getting Started

> [!NOTE]
> DAPper is very early in development -- things may not work as expected or be implemented yet!
> Feel free to start a discussion in https://github.com/LLNL/dapper/discussions for things you'd like to see.

### Download pre-built binary (Coming soon):

Soon we will provide pre-built dapper binaries on GitHub that can be downloaded.

### Install from crates.io (Recommended for users):

For ease of use, we recommend using [rustup.rs](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) which is a Rust installer and version management tool. Install `rustup` by following [their installation instructions](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

After that, install DAPper with (replacing <version> with the version to install):

```bash
cargo install dapper@<version>
```

### Build from Source (Recommended for developers):

For ease of use, we recommend using [rustup.rs](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) which is a Rust installer and version management tool. Install `rustup` by following [their installation instructions](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

1. Clone the DAPper git repository using `git`

```bash
git clone https://github.com/LLNL/dapper.git
cd dapper
``` 

2. Build DAPper

```bash
cargo build --release
```

Note: Use `cargo run --` in place of `dapper` for any commands listed in the Usage section below.

### Usage

Install datasets using `dapper db install ubuntu-noble`, `dapper db install pypi`, and optionally `dapper db install nuget`.

Run `dapper <source code directory or file>`. The output will be the #included files from each C/C++ and Python source code file found.
