This problem setup is to test the ability of ERF to correctly use files created 
by the WRF Preprocessing System (WPS), or initial data from a metgrid NetCDF file,
to initialize the problem and provide time-dependent boundary conditions.

Use inputs_wps_noahmp to run this test using the Noah-MP land surface model. Make
sure to copy `../../../Submodules/Noah-MP/drivers/erf/NoahmpTable.TBL` into this
directory before running the simulation.
