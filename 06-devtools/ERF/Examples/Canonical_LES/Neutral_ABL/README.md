# Canonical Neutral ABL

This is an example input file for a conventional (conditionally) neutral atmospheric boundary layer
(ABL) based on Case B from Berg et al. 2010, JAS.

The solver executable is compiled in Exec/ABL and provides options for initial perturbations
including deterministic divergence-free velocity perturbations as well as random velocity and/or
temperature perturbations.
