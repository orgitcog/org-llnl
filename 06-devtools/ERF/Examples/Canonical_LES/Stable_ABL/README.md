# Canonical Stable ABL

This is an example input file for a stable atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) based on the GABLS1
setup. For wind energy applications, if wind conditions are desired at/near hub height, they may be
specified as a fixed mass flux within the rotor layer.

The solver executable is compiled in Exec/ABL and provides options for initial perturbations
including deterministic divergence-free velocity perturbations as well as random velocity and/or
temperature perturbations.
