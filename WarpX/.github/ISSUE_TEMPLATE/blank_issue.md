Are you here because you have something to report that is neither a bug, a new feature, nor an installation problem?

Before opening this issue, consider opening a [discussion](https://github.com/BLAST-WarpX/warpx/discussions) instead!

Issues are used to report bugs, installation problems or to request new features.
Discussions are used to ask more open-ended questions, brainstorm, ask our feedback, etc.

You can find more details on how to use issues and discussions [here](https://github.com/BLAST-WarpX/warpx/blob/development/CONTRIBUTING.rst).
