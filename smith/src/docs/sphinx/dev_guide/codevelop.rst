Co-Developing with Axom and MFEM
================================

Occasionally, Smith developers may want to patch fixes and useful features back to MFEM and Axom. A co-development build
environment is available to expedite this process via `git submodules <https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules>`_.

To enable a co-develop workflow, use the following steps from the root Smith directory:

#. **Initialize submodules.**
   Axom and MFEM are submodules of the Smith repository.  The following command recursively updates all submodules:

   .. code-block:: bash

      $ git submodule update --init --recursive

#. **Generate Build System via CMake.**
   Configure our CMake build with the co-develop option using a local host-config
   (CMake initial cache) generated by Spack.  You can do this one of two ways:

   .. code-block:: bash

      # Option 1: This uses CMake to configure Axom, MFEM, and Smith in one step.
      $ ./config-build.py -hc <host config file> -DSMITH_ENABLE_CODEVELOP=ON
      $ cd <build directory> # this is autogenerated by script based on host-config name
      
      # Option 2:
      $ mkdir <build directory>
      $ cd <build directory>
      $ cmake -C <host config file> -DSMITH_ENABLE_CODEVELOP=ON ..

#. **Build/Test code.**
   Build MFEM, Axom, and Smith:

   .. code-block:: bash

      $ make -j
      $ make -j test
