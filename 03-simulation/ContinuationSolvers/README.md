## HomotopySolver
This repository contains two homotopy solvers. First is for constrained optimization via the interior-point method, the second is a mixed nonlinear complementarity problem solver.

## Description
With this project one can solve nonlinear complementarity problems as defined by a GeneralNLMCProblem (see problems/NLMCProblems.hpp). One can also solve constrained optimization problems by the interior-point method as defined by a ParGeneralOptProblem (see problems/OptProblems.hpp).

## Installation
1. Install [mfem](https://mfem.org/). 
2. Edit the MFEM_DIR and MFEM_BUILD_DIR variables in homotopysolver/Makefile and problems/Makefile
3. Make and run e.g., (from homotopysolver/problems)
make TestProblem1
mpirun -np 4 ./TestProblem1
